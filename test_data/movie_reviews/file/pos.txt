bizarre horror movie filled with famous faces but stolen by cristina raines later of tvs flamingo road as a pretty but somewhat unstable model with a gummy smile who is slated to pay for her attempted suicides by guarding the gateway to hell the scenes with raines modeling are very well captured the mood music is perfect deborah raffin is charming as cristinas pal but when raines moves into a creepy brooklyn heights brownstone inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor things really start cooking the neighbors including a fantastically wicked burgess meredith and kinky couple sylvia miles  beverly dangelo are a diabolical lot and eli wallach is great fun as a wily police detective the movie is nearly a cross pollination of rosemarys baby and the exorcist but what a combination based on the best seller by jeffrey konvitz the sentinel is entertainingly spooky full of shocks brought off well by director michael winner who mounts a thoughtfully downbeat ending with skill 12 from 
a solid if unremarkable film matthau as einstein was wonderful my favorite part and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badmitton i loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for robbins to retrieve the birdie
it is a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their rollicking kids i felt like instead of a movie ticket i should have been given a nambla membership based upon thomas rockwells respected book how to eat fried worms starts like any childrens story moving to a new town the new kid fifth grader billy forrester was once popular but has to start anew making friends is never easy especially when the only prospect is poindexter adam or erica who at 4 12 feet is a giant further complicating things is joe the bully his freckled face and sleeveless shirts are daunting he antagonizes kids with the death ring a crackerjack ring that is rumored to kill you if you are punched with it but not immediately no the death ring unleashes a poison that kills you in the eight grade joe and his axis of evil welcome billy by smuggling a handful of slimy worms into his thermos once discovered billy plays it cool swearing that he eats worms all the time then he throws them at joes face ewww to win them over billy reluctantly bets that he can eat 10 worms fried boiled marinated in hot sauce squashed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich each meal is dubbed an exotic name like the radioactive slime delight in which the kids finally live out their dream of microwaving a living organism if you have ever met me you will know that i have an uncontrollably hearty laugh i felt like a creep erupting at a toddler whining that his dilly dick hurts but fried worms is wonderfully disgusting like a g rated farrelly brothers film it is both vomitous and delightful writerdirector bob dolman is also a savvy storyteller to raise the stakes the worms must be consumed by 7 pm in addition billy holds a dark secret he has an ultra sensitive stomach dolman also has a keen sense of perspective with such accuracy he draws on childrens insecurities and tendency to exaggerate mundane dilemmas if you were to hyperbolize this movie the way kids do their quandaries you will see that it is essentially about war freedom fighter and freedom hater use pubescent boys as pawns in proxy wars only to learn a valuable lesson in unity international leaders can learn a thing or two about global peacekeeping from fried worms at the end of the film i was comforted when two chaperoning mothers behind me looked at each other with befuddlement and agreed that was a great movie  great now i will not have to register myself in any lawful databases
you probably all already know this by now but 5 additional episodes never aired can be viewed on abc com i have watched a lot of television over the years and this is possibly my favorite show ever it is a crime that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled the actors that played laura whit carlos mae damian anya and omg steven caseman are all incredible and so natural in those roles even the kids are great wonderful show so sad that it is gone of course i wonder about the reasons it was canceled there is no way i will let myself believe that ms moynahans pregnancy had anything to do with it it was in the perfect time slot in this market i have watched all the episodes again on abc com i hope they all come out on dvd some day thanks for reading
i saw the movie with two grown children although it was not as clever as shrek i thought it was rather good in a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break there was not a sound so i know the children all liked it there parents also seemed engaged the death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids as such it was successful although i liked it too personally i liked the scrat
you are using the imdb you have given some hefty votes to some of your favourite films it is something you enjoy doing and it is all because of this fifty seconds one world ends another begins how can it not be given a ten i wonder at those who give this a seven or an eight exactly how could the first film ever made be better for the record the long still opening shot is great showmanship a superb innovation perfectly suited to the situation and the dog on the bike is a lovely touch all this within fifty seconds the word genius is often overused this is genius
this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption i loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family well acted and well directed if there were any flaws i would have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again what about all people of all cultural backgrounds i would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown like in real life nevertheless the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes
made after quartet was trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham here the three stories are the verger mr know it all and sanitorium the first two are comic the verger is like a prolonged joke but one with a good pay off and the last more serious as health issues are involved again the author introduces the film and the stories james hayter soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick is the hero in the verger he holds this small custodial type job in a church but the new vicar michael hordern is an intellectual snob when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him hayter has saved some money so he tells his wife kathleen harrison he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop he has a good eye and his store thrives soon he has a whole chain of stores when his grandchild is christened by hordern the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex verger the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments i will leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting according to maugham he met a man like max kelada nigel patrick on a cruise in mr know it all kelada is a splashy friendly and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip regarding jewelry by steamship his state room mate is mr grey the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde white who is somewhat silently disapproving of max max likes to enliven things and soon is heavily involved in the ships entertainment at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non maugham story and film china seas 1935 as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real i will not describe the way max rises to the occasion sanitorium is the longest segment roland culver plays ashenden the fictional alter ego of maugham a writer and one time spy as in hitchcocks the secret agent here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health he finds a remarkable crew of people including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman finlay currie as an irascible scotsman john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is at war with currie raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions the last dealing with simmons and rennie is ironic but deeply moving it was a dandy follow up to the earlier quartet and well worth watching
for a mature man to admit that he she would a tear over this film is a mature response to a mature film if one need admit more then perhaps one could say that life can never be the same after viewing such advent for it has moved us to the next level

when i rented this movie to watch it i knew that it was not going to be a mindbender movie instead i thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating and you know what it worked kurt russel did what i though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was i recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film
it is hard to say sometimes why exactly a film is so effective from the moment i first came across the stone boy something told me it would be a great film in spite of that it seemed very unlikely that i would ever have the opportunity to actually see it for myself then one day while looking through the online catalogue of my local library i saw that they had recently purchased the dvd release of this film which i am extremely glad for because the cinematography is of a stunning depth and quality that an old vhs copy could never replicate and speaking of the cinematography i must single it out as far and above the most stunning aspect of this film as a photographer who pursues very nearly the exact visual style portrayed in the stone boy i am a firm believer in the fact that a great cinematographer can almost single handedly carry a film here he has a lot of help from an extremely talented cast and a director who understands perfectly what the story needs but to have juan ruiz anchía behind the camera makes virtually every scene something of beauty and you can almost never say that most films would never even expect such a thing of you scene after scene captures some detail some little bit of visual magic that takes your breath away the director christopher cain has had a long and interesting career as far as i can gather this film is not very representative of it but sometimes to catch a director near the beginnings of his career before all the big budgets and loss of focus there is a real subtle magic to be found cain steps back in this film let us things happen with a life of their own and then ever further much like early john sayles films characters are given space to breathe time to talk side stories happen because they do and that is how life is cain displays a remarkable raw even outright painful understanding of human nature in this film the acting ties much of this story together when people talk when they exist in this film they do so as actual people not held back by the fact that they are playing characters gina berriaults script allows immensely talented and respected actors like wilford brimley robert duvall glenn close and frederic forrest to spend time simply existing whether the things they have to say are minor or of deep significance it all comes down with the weight of pure reality when you look at the actors involved or the great soundtrack by james horner it seems strange that such a film be very nearly forgotten maybe much of what makes the stone boy what it is was the time period it was made in there is this 1970s hangover feeling to this picture that reminds me deeply of my own childhood people talk of the 80s in terms of modern styles and music but that is not the 80s i lived in or remember the look of the images the understated and dark knowing quality of the acting and the overall result should get under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this era of time in north america i see myself in this i see how i saw the world and a film like the stone boy sees the world for how it truly is for more of this feeling please seethe black stallion 1979 never cry wolf 1983 tender mercies 1983 testament 1983 places in the heart 1984 matewan 1987 high tide 1987 driving miss daisy 1989 the secret garden 1993 the secret of roan inish 1994 wendy and lucy 2008
yes this gets the full ten stars it is plain as day that this fill is genius the universe sent trent harris a young wonderfully strange man one day and harris caught him on tape in all that true misfit glory that you just can not fake too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man if only an alternate ending could be written for that fellows story the other two steps in the trilogy do retell the story with sean penn and crispin glover in the roles of the young men respectively the world is expanded upon and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling giving us a broader glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla america recommended for anyone and everyone
hello this movie is well okay just kidding its awesome it is not a block buster smash hit it is not meant to be but its a big hit in my world and my sisters we are rockin rollers go ramones this is a great movie for me
this is a film that was very well done i had heard mixed reviews while it was in production and have been waiting for its release cheers to the director and all the actors the supporting cast gave eva mendez what she needed to take this to the top as everyone else here states the latter portion of the film is riveting katie cassidy did an amazing job with her character being she had not done a lot of work when this film was made she has quite the career ahead of her i was amazed at her performance i completely enjoyed the film questioned my values in life and priorities and am a better person for it a great message lies within the film release it so all can enjoy
a typical romp through cheech and chongs reality which includes drugs singing more drugs cars and driving even more drugs pee wee aliens gasoline laundry stand up comedy surprisingly more drugs and space coke  it is not as coherent or plausible as up in smoke but it still is incredibly funny without becoming as strange as nice dreams there are some classic scenes which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work also funny is cheechs song mexican americans and chongs follow up song another notable scene is the welfare office scene with jones human noise machine from the police academy series and the old laughing man all in all this is a great follow up to up in smoke and is quite watchable when sober or not celluloid rehab
ok here is what i say the movie was excellent i am a huge nancy fan and i have read all 1 56 original books and i went on to read more i am now on 96 beware of villains giving this movie a lower grade than it should have all clues point to a wonderful movie i loved the whole thing so what nancy is in current time she is still old fashioned like she is in the books people who have not read more than 5 books are complaining about the view of nancy i have read all of them and i think emma is perfect and that nancy was perfect i found parts of the movie spooky i loved the exciting car chases and get aways i loved the clues i solved the mystery myself it was really wonderful i suggest you go see it since people who have been complaining know nothing of a what a good movie is and b about nancy drew go see it it may not be oscar worthy but its really a good movie
this is one of the first films i can remember or maybe the first one exactly the beautiful kind of film than introduce a kid sweetly into the world of violence and addictions were we live a little bit of babe casino and constantine all this well mixed into a carton and we get this i do not know if its truly rated for kids but i think it was very cool very funny and interesting i hate when a film spescially a cartoncan have a good end and its ruining because every character must have a happy end even if it sounds weird i am not a bitter person but this was ok he simply goes heaven and they let it in that way all this is just a critic its a good movie an something new very touching and i got to go
this film is worth seeing alone for jared harris outstanding portrayal of john lennon it does not matter that harris does not exactly resemble lennon his mannerisms expressions posture accent and attitude are pure lennon best scene lennon in a local cafe verbally sparring with a stuttering fan as to whether paul mccartney  wings silly love songs is worthy of 1 status in america
i was 10 years old when this show was on tv by far it was my favorite the actors were very credible alexandra bastedo was just gorgeous i just order the dvd 15 episodes they did not have super powers they just had superior human skills strength hearing sight the 3 actors were very good in their rolls very believable there was a good story in each episode at the time there were no special effects or explosions everywhere so the script was suppose to be good and the characters performs were great there was no fancy stuff like in other shows they did not try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show i highly recommend this tv show to anybody that like good stuff
here is another movie that should be loaded into a satellite fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip off of the already bad movie classic king kong from 1976 that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness but successfully predicted much of peter jacksons miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name as far as a romance between the giant here a yeti and a gorgeous human female antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzis city of the living dead who is very easy on the eyes the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness but as a trade off you do get a wacky old scientist two inquisitive kids tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti who turns out to be the good guy glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands a monster who is size literally changes scale from shot to shot some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison crowd reaction shots a plenty made up of either spanish italian or canadian extras depending upon scene you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie it is here that the film won me over it is enthusiasm just for being made frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in 1968 and gods gun the year before this  was a very important director in the spaghetti western and actionadventure genre film scene from the 1960s1970s and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever or rather the one he took the most chances with and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids  families the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless or rather they are part of the fun and if the movie had been played seriously it would not have worked which is exactly why peter jacksons movie sucked he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators and with all it is faults  clunkiness kramers yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space i would rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever because the movie looks so fake you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked trampled tossed about and smashed knowing that and armed with a fertile energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid 1010 it is about ten minutes too long but who cares you only come around once and i would rather go out with a smile on my face
to all the reviewers on this page i would have to say this movie is worth seeing so it was made in 1972 so what the fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time people who did not study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball compared to the modern series left behind which is made for our time right now it does look cheezy however the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion which again was over 30 years in the past but the message that is sent in this film is very powerful and carefully preserved there is just so much to say but i refuse to say it for fear of spoiling it so go out and see this film if you do not like the message that it sends then you have issues that need some attention
a favourite of minethis movie tells of two feuding new york characters steve brodieraft and chuck connorsbeerywho both strive to be the main guy in the bowery in the late nineteenth century brodie1863 1901 and connors1852 1913were real peoplethough this is a heavily fictionalized account of their anticsbased on a play brodies legendarydid he do it it is still a because of argumentjump from the brooklyn bridge1886for which he became famousis shown here as happening around the same time as the spanish american war1898 director walsh clearly had a great affection for the periodso beautifully recreated hereand it includes a wild rumbustious ragtime number from saloon singer trixie odbraya young pert kelton raft is at his slickest as brodieand beery shows again what a clever actor he wasas tough big hearted and at times quite touching connors pretty fay wray is the love interest both the boys are pursuing full of life and energythe bowery moves at a fast paceunlike many early talkies it is not an easy movie to findbut is well worth looking out for
as most off you might off seen star wars return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they mmight have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one live tv when they are partying but before i say more when ben obi wan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader real name anakin skywalker when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground
i thought this movie was lol funny it is a fun not to be taken seriously movie about one mans twisted views on life love and well ladies from the lowly bus station skank to the high class débutante bus station skank  tim meadows plays a guy leon phelps who was raised by in a playboy style mansion by a hugh hefner esquire father figure surrounded constantly by beautiful porn models and actresses when his father kicks him out on the street he must learn to fend for himself with nothing but the chauvinistic outlook on life that his youth has taught him that and an unfathomable nearly mystical level of charm and dumb luck and so the hijinx begin if you have not seen this movie and you enjoy a light hearted semi mindless comedylove story then i highly recommend renting the ladies man
hood of the living dead had a lot to live up to even before the opening credits began first any play on of the living dead invokes his holiness mr romero and instantly sets up a high standard to which many movies cannot afford to aspire and second my movie watching companion professed doubt that any urban horror film would surpass the seminal leprechaun in the hood skeptical we settled in to watch we were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and good hearted zombie film oh certainly the budget is low and of course the directors amateurs friends populate the cast but hood of the living dead loves zombie cinema cheap yeah but when it is this cheap you can clearly see where love holds it together ricky works in a lab during the day and as a surrogate parent to his younger brother at night he dreams of moving out of oakland before this planned escape however his brother is shot to death in a drive by rickys keen scientific mind presents an option superior to cpr or 911 injections of his labs experimental regenerative formula sadly little bro wakes up in an ambulance as a bloodthirsty oakland zombie chaos and mayhem i think it is more economical to eat your enemies than take vengeance in a drive by but then again i am a poor judge of the complexities of urban life how poor a judge in response to a gory scene involving four men i opined ah ha white t shirts on everyone so the blood shows up economical i used the same technique in my own low budget horror film  jordan replied no that is gang dress white t shirts were banned from new orleans bars for a time as a result  oh a lot of the movie is set in someone is living room so there is a great deal of hanging out and waiting for the zombies but the characters are sympathetic and the movie is sincere it surpasses its budget in spirit zombie explanation when man plays god zombies arise or perhaps follow fda approved testing rules before human experimentation contribution to the zombie canon this is the first zombie movie i have seen with a drive by shooting as far as the actual zombies go infection is spread with a bite as usual but quite unusually head shots do not work it is heart shots that kill zombies have pulses the absence of which proves true death and these zombies make pretty cool jaguar growl noises gratuitous zombie movie in joke a mercenary named romero groan favorite zombie jaguar noise little brother zombie of course
pierce brosnan the newest but no longer james bond is an assassin he is very very good at what he does but he is getting old and tired greg kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives then one night they are having drinks in a bar and they begin to talk then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events the story is excellent the acting is top notch and the humor is hilarious i never thought that pierce brosnan would be this funny but he really is and i must say this movie is a must see
this is one of those filmspilot that if you knew battlestar galactica it helps but is not necessary what makes this even more believable of a story than bsg is that this is not something so far away in the future this has such a depth to it that it is quite astonishing it was not released theatrically the leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced  quite talented actors eric stoltz is superb as the father who will do anything to be re united whis daughter however real or not she is  he will do it no matter the cost paula malcomson of deadwood fame is terrific as his wife as well you are not sure completely of his motives whether it is love or money or both but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing i see a star in the making of zoe played by the relative unknown alessandra torresani  her performance esai morales is terrific in his desire to see his loved one again  just how wrong to be even considering what he wants more than his moral objections i did not think this would be a good idea when it was announced but from the pilot alone i am thrilled to see how we got to the bsg stage story it is great to see adama as a child already being affected  influenced by the different sorts of robots starting to permeate life at this stage i just hope that they can keep up the stories so we can figure out even more how they got the the humanoid typed robots this is an almost perfect pilot  i hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen if you have not gotten into bsg  least try this  i will bet you become a fan  will want to see how the bsg story came to be
this could not have been better the strong restraints on mike sullivans expressions could not have been portrayed in any other way tom hanks delivers the best performance of his career young tyler hoechlin drives an emotional wheel playing the basis character for the story and veteran paul newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time this film is based on a bold graphic novel by max allan collins and richard piers rayner this is a fatherson story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles mike sullivan had no father as a child so john rooney took him in although a generous man mr rooney involved himself in organized crime therefore the debt of sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business now sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe but at the same time pay back his boss the events to follow will test sullivans loyalty and embrace his familys fate with a great adaptation by david self the dialogue comes out seldomly but yet very virtuous the story unfolds in a beautiful 1930s setting brilliant art direction by richard l johnson  nancy haigh covered with a dark rainy snow on the ground exterior driving the story is thomas newmans wonderful irish score settling in only when necessary but the most important technical element in the film is conrad l halls beautiful photography this is some of the best cinematography i have seen and i watch a lot of films the scene when mike and michael are in the car entering chicago is quite impressive the shot starts at the front of the car revealing mikehanks through the windshield it subsequently dollys around to the side of the car to see michaelhoechlin awakening and peering out his side window as it continues it trucks sideways and dollys back completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic 1930s chicago with a great cast and crew the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film i am talking about sam mendes who made his feature film debut in 1999 with american beauty won him various awards before american beauty mendes worked as a play director for the british theater but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater with only two films sam mendes has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors in a list of about twenty five the film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly the photography acting and story is phenominal i am still waiting for scorcesees gangs of new york but for now i am fully confident in saying that this is the best film of the year considering it is competition signs insomnia minority report that is a strong statement
i was probably one of the few australians not watching the tennis when this series aired i have to say when william mcinnes first appeared i though that is one crappy actor but as the series continued he toned down his performance and i totally loved him he was such a rotten guy but he did make me laugh i watched the show to see hugo speers heart and bones the full monty and tom long seachange two hands it was interesting to see speers play a nice quiet man and even more interesting to watch tom longs rippling muscles sigh seriously longs performance was a total shock and really brilliant he stole the show martin sacks was good also in a small role and the leading actress put in an entertaining performance i would recommend this programme if you enjoy stories with a twist and watching tom long walk around with no shirt on
my evaluation 810i like a lot this movie compare to today brainless movie just action and special effet and nothing new about ideas soylent green ask to something that today does not exist anymore to think well it would not a big surprise a day human eat cookies which are create with body of human with all what happen on this planet and to see how people are so indifferent to all this kind of future is possible sure this movie take some age but the idea behind the movie is actual again rich at paradise other in the hell well a luck today they are tv and idiocy like reality show tv is a good wash brain it is pity to see that intelligence of human have not progress like technologies since writing all stop if you like reality show this movie is not for you if you believe all politician same too if you do not like ask yourself question about now and future well never look this movie
james stewart stars in a classic western tale of revenge which ties in with the fate of the films other star the winchester rifle stewart is it goes without saying excellent adding some cold hard obsession to his usual laid back cowboy the story follows the fate of a winchester rifle and its owners after being won in a competition by our hero and stolen by the man he is hunting we meet a selection of gamblers gun fighters indian traders and bank robers as we follow the rifles path through indian battles bank heists etc the supporting cast are all solid with dan durya standing out as waco johnny dean the live wire gunfighter with an itchy trigger finger also as a trivia note a very early appearance from rock hudson as an indian chief the end showdown is a classic a tense rifle battle fought at long range in and around a rocky outcrop throw in some good old western action fist fights shootouts and horseback chases it makes for a rollicking western adventure 810
this movie did not really surprise me as such it just got better and better i thought paul rieser wrote this huh well we will see how he does  then i saw peter falk was in it i appreciate colombo even though i was never a big fan of the show i have always liked watching peter falk the performances of peter and paul were so natural that i felt like a fly on the wall they played off of each other so well that i practically felt giddy with enjoyment and i had not even been drinkingthis movie was so well done that i wanted to get right on the phone to paul and let him know how much i enjoyed it but i could not find his number must be unlisted or something this was one of those movies that i had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything it just came on and i thoughteh why not let us see if i do not like it i do not have to watch it  and i ended up just loving it
one of the most nihilistic and brutal films i have ever seen but also one of the most tragic and moving ones this is an action melodrama like the world has never seen it before sometimes the plot got me close to tears while in the next moment delivering shocking revelations like a bone crunching blow to the guts chilling performance by edison chen the story of a hk cop and a cambodian killer hunting each other down while bit by bit losing their humanity is a strong one featuring very little dialog in favor of haunting imagery and gritty camera work dog bite dog is pure hk bloodshed without the heroism
this is an excellent film for female body builder  female action fans i think that sue price did a great job in this film series nemesis 234 and proved to be a great fighter she has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful nebula nemesis 2 though not a film of great value and sue prices acting skills not the best to have met in my life the movie itself was something awesome a priceless gem for fans of female body builder action well some parts of nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci fi films such as terminator or predator but that is not the point the point is that a puyn casted in that film a very talented body builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do i really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm nemesis 3 a rather boring sequel and nemesis 4 a much more interesting sequel than 3 what a pity it has not shown yet on dvd  
this is a great movie that i do not think gets enough credit as saturday night fever or grease in john travoltas career he plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her instead he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood even though it was made in 1980 it is still timely today the great country music soundtrack is terrific 1010
one of the best love stories i have ever seen it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion but lovely nonetheless big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly and are infinitely quotable it is a goddamned beautiful day now will you just shut up the opening explanation of little edies costume only promises that the movie will live on forever and so will big edie the world famous singer and little edie  the world famous dancer 
thanks should be given to the hong kong vcddvd distributors that i only paid us1 4 and i could have such a surprisingly delightful enjoyment adultery how common in our modern days eva grabbed her two children and kidnapped nick to chase after luis and charlotte to italy she wants her revenge done but at the end she also commits the same crime of luis she had sex with nick in this small indie production vivian naefe dealt with the teething problems in modern marriage with a light heart how can one dare treat marriage seriously in this fast food time where people are now of higher mobility in physical mental and technology areas conjugal commitment asks for too high a price that most people would choose to succumb to circumstances nick once trusted charlotte but he fell for eva after that kidnap journey which forced him to experience much growth most viewers may feel happy about the ending because eva and nick come together well this should be the greatest retribution to the unfaithful act of their spouses however i want a sequel i want to see how the four would develop after this exchange perhaps they may exchange back how can one be so sure about the shaky love relationship good acting and good scenery the two little child actors should not be neglected especially the boy when he cries at the reception of the hotel in venezia and of course how can we forget the bella bella scenery of the city
mesmerizing breathtaking and horrifying this hauntingly beautiful film is the apocalypse now without fiction slow in pace quiet in mood it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom there is no doubt in my mind the nature is plagued and we are the disease greed the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress has turned us into something like cancer on its way to consume the host and die with it manufactured landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience at least i will never regard my toaster and iron the same way again
i have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel jane eyre both dalton and clarke are very believable as rochester and jane i have seen other versions but none compare to this one the best one for me i could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again the last time i saw this one was in 1984 when i was only 13 at that time i was a bookworm and i had just read charlotte brontes novel i was completely enchanted by this miniseries and i remember not missing any of the episodes i would like to see it again because it is so good  
at first glance it would seem natural to compare where the sidewalk ends with laura both have noirish qualities both were directed by otto preminger and both star dana andrews and gene tierney but that is where most of the comparisons end laura dealt with posh sophisticated people with means who just happen to find themselves mixed up in a murder where the sidewalk ends is set in a completely different strata these are people with barely two nickels to rub together who are more accustomed to seeing the underbelly of society than going to fancy dress parties where the sidewalk ends is a gritty film filled with desperate people who solve their problems with their fists or some other weapon small time hoods are a dime a dozen and cops routinely beat confessions out of the crooks getting caught up in a murder investigation seems as natural as breathing while i have not seen his entire body of work based on what i have seen dana andrews gives one of his best performances as the beat down cop det sgt mark dixon he is the kind of cop who is used to roughing up the local hoods if it gets him information or a confession one night he goes too far and accidentally kills a man he does his best to cover it up but things get complicated when he falls for the dead mans wife morgan taylor tierney whose father becomes suspect number one in the murder case as morgans father means the world to her dixons got to do what he can to clear the old man without implicating himself technically where the sidewalk ends is outstanding besides the terrific performance from andrews the movie features the always delightful tierney she has a quality that can make even the bleakest of moments seem brighter the rest of the cast is just as solid with tom tully as the wrongly accused father being a real standout beyond the acting the direction sets lighting and cinematography are all top notch overall it is an amazingly well made film if i have one complaint and admittedly it is a very very minor quibble it is that tierney is almost too perfect for the role and her surroundings it is a little difficult to believe that a woman like that could find herself mixed up with some of these unsavory characters it is not really her fault it is just the way tierney comes across she seems a little too beautiful polished and delicate for the part but her gentle kind trusting nature add a sense of needed realism to her portrayal
castle of blood aka castle of terror is a well crafted surprisingly spooky entry from italian director anthony dawson exquisite black and white cinematography flawless dubbing superb casting fairly logical scripting deliberate pacing and a surprise though totally appropriate ending set this one apart only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt love at first sight between elizabeth barbara steele and alan georges rivière mar an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie while visiting england edgar allan poe sits in a pub telling one of his ghostly stories to count blackwood recognizing the great writer alan a young news reporter requests an interview with poe during the course of the conversation poe reveals that all of his stories are true incredulous alan expresses his skepticism about life after death count blackwood offers to bet alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in blackwoods castle a night following halloween when the dead walk alan cannot afford the bet so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager unlike mario bavas overpraised black sunday aka the mask of satan castle of blood is fairly restrained making the few moments of violence even more dreadful especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible italian space movies from the 60s it is a pity the only version of this film i have found is badly deteriorated and recorded pan and scan version even so it is well worth seeing and cries out for a modern remake perhaps with christina ricci or jennifer love hewitt in the role of elizabeth watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with robert wises the haunting
cuban blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way i actually watched it while sailing around cuba on a western caribbean cruise it details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end when the socialist regime came and took the property of the boys father the majority of the film is the boys coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else there are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to a class a film with fine acting and directing this is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists it is a film about people and their lives their mistakes and their triumphs a good film worth watching several times annually
henri verneuils film may be not so famous as parallax view 3 days of the condor or jfk but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre action takes place in fictional western state where fictional president has been killed after several years of investigation special government commission decides that president was killed by a lone gunman but one man prosecutor volney played by yves montand thinks there is something more to be investigated and so the film starts this movie does not deal with some exact theories but it embraces the whole structure of relationship between government and society in todays world such film could be made only in the 1970 ies but it will never lose it is actuality furthermore it is even a bit frightful how precise are it is oracles 10 out of 10
did you ever wonder how far one movie could go schizophreniac relentlessly explores the world of the extreme with harry russo harry is an aggravated writer killer and drug addict scumbag who will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and insanity driven by the demonic voices of his ventriloquist dummy rubberneck harry begins his killing spree from director ron atkins comes the 1st installment of the vilest story ever to be filmedthe only other movie i have seen similar to this would happen to be the 2nd installment entitled schizophreniac necromaniacthis is a really low budget film and will not be for everyone but if you are looking for something disturbing different and horrific then this would make a fine choice do not expect anything like modern day horror such as screamviewer discretion is advised
as a long standing barbra fan any posting like this will be biased that aside this film ranks as a classic it has it is flaws emphasized in other postings but gives a glimpse of a time late 70s that will never be there again and is fascinating to watch unfold on screen streisand fought hard to make this movie her own i do not think she was ever satisfied but it gives her fans a new barbra for the time with live singing a young fresh appearance and some very heavy duty acting the story is rough but exciting and holds your interest throughout the extended one frame finale is hard for most non barbra fans to sit through but it speaks volumes to those who admire her talent
i happen to run into this movie one night so i decided to watch it i was very pleased with the movie i thought it was a wonderful plot it is a great feeling knowing a deceased one has come back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say and this wife stayed devoted for 23 years i thought it was a great movie
i realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title this movie is not primarily about the act of riding giants but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport riding giants to change the emphasis in my teens i lived a block from the wedge one of the hardest breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world i have been out in 15 to 18 foot surf and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12 foot waves on many occasions that experience is why i am in complete awe of the surfers in this film the idea that jeff clark to all appearances a normal mortal could get away with riding mavericks by himself for over a decade is beyond my grasp the first safety rule of any water sport is never surfdiveswim by yourself  he went where sane people would not and lived to tell about it i would not go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left in the world of warm water the first shot of the waves at jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body these are not just scary waves these are uncontrolled bowel evacuation waves when we see laird hamilton not only surviving 40 to 60 foot waves i can hardly type those numbers but actually working the faces like a fun day at rincon i am blown away there is a dedication and focus in big wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world this a great film i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it neglects to mention that there are great big wave riders in the world outside the hamiltonkalama crew and i think they deserved mention splice in ken bradshaw at outside log cabins and a 10 it is
i am writing this after just seeing the perfect son at the 2002 gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival in sydney australia when their father dies two estranged brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers is dying from aids they enter on a heart warming journey of reconciliation the two leads do a magnificent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that builds up between them as the movie progresses i do have one qualm about the movie though whilst the brother who is dying acts sick he does not look it a person of 0 t4 cells would look quite ill not even a make up job to make the actor look ill was employed a small gripe but one that makes it a bit less realistic despite that one small gripe the perfect son is a wonderful movie and should you have the chance to see it do i am hoping for a dvd release in the near future
the premise of the story is simple an old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a small child and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred though very little dialog is provided throughout the film the visual narrative told by the cameras eye alone made the film quite engaging the setting of the gray woods conveys a feeling of loneliness which complements the quietness of the characters themselves we can also sense helplessness in the old mans inability to convince the police of the murder which parallels the silenced childs inability to tell her own story true horror lies in feelings of hopelessness helplessness and irrationality this film successfully addresses these elements by visuals alone rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weak cleverly the story unfolds at a slow pace to build up tension for a few creepy and startling moments the ending is also unexpected and believable reminiscent of japanese horror films such as the ring and dark water or english horror films such as lady in black and the innocents this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror i recommend anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the bone scare to give this film a try by the way if you have not seen the films i just mentioned above you might want to give them a try as well
i saw this film a while back and it is still at the top of my favorite movies list it is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed tid bits such as the cafe bustelo coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash her grandsons hair that people are not seeing because you will not understand this movie unless you are hispanic this is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it is being built upon i completely see what the writerdirector was going for and he hit the target perfectly this film is highly deserving of a better rating
i work with children from 0  6 years old and they all love the doodlebops the doodlebops are energetic vibrant and appealing once they start singing we are the doodlebops we are the doodlebops we are the doodlebops oh yeah come and join the fun because we are laughing and we are singing all day it is almost impossible not to join them in song the doodlebops brings the viewer into a world of color and fun each show is an adventure the doodlebops do not try to change the world with preachy messages all they do is have fun while sorting out everyday life challenges that the young child may relate to the doodlebops is an refreshing high action alternative to regular childrens television programs
this independent film was one of the best films at the tall grass film festival that i have ever seen there i loved it there are so many things that was great about the film on top of all that the cast and crew that i had the opportunity to meet were absolutely phenomenal i thought that avi did a great job in his role and ricky ullman was absolutely true to his role for a disney actor i was amazed at his talent to be able to go from cheesy teen comedy to such an adult role with no problems the talent in the film was just amazing the cinematography was just great if you want to see an independent film this is one really that you should see i think that mr gruver would have been so proud to have such a submission in his festival and his parents loved the movie so much when it won the audience favorite they went and saw it again this truly was a great film it was dark and funny and sad and truly emotional it was just fabulous i am honestly just so enthused by this film and i really do not want to spoil it for any one just see it and truly be amazed at it i think that these film makers really have what it takes to go places and i hope to see more work from them in the future
to make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about kip giovanni ribsi a car thief who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars 50 in total he is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the order the objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days with the help of randall nicolas cage a retired booster and also kips brother and a couple of old friends of randalls as you can see this is the same old big bro needs to get lil bro out of trouble routine and of course randall is the best thief there ever was of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of but at times it is predictable too so there is nothing fancy about the story you are by now probably wondering why this is about 51 times the hot stuff since there are only 50 beautiful fast cool and expensive cars to be stolen well the other hot item in this film is sway angelina jolie who will be a big star trust me she is not only very convincing in the role as a car theft but she is pretty hot too ok not hot as in pretty but hot as in damn cool and sexy she was very believable in this role probably because she is some kind of a wild woman in real life too do not believe me read her biography and for the sexy part well just see for yourself man i only know that she plays the kind of girl i like in this film because she is not too mainstream a bit alternative look and she even comes with a tattoo ok the only downsides i felt while watching this movie was that there is not very much action there is one totally unrealistic scene the story is only ok and that there are not much jokes hey but after seeing the whole film i must say who cares why must i say that well because it was still entertaining had a couple of cool car chases good music some bruckheimer scenes where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet good actors who all did their jobs pretty cars one cool wild sexy lady yes i mean mrs jolie and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with so some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie all in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall ok movie with a cool  feelgood ending as for nicolas cage well
forbidden planet is the best sf film from the golden age of sf cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder as soon as the spaceship lands the audience via the ships human crew travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure we meet the unforgetable robbie  the mysterious dr morbuis  his beautiful and innocent daughter altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet the krell who died out overnight or did they  you can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia i feel and bebe and louis barrons electronic music adds even more atmosphere im shocked this film isnt in the top 250 imdb films
halfway through lajos koltais evening a woman on her deathbed asks a figure appearing in her hallucination can you tell me where my life went the line could be embarrassingly theatrical but the woman speaking it is vanessa redgrave delivering it with utter simplicity and the question tears your heart out time and again the film based on susan minots novel skirts sentimentality and ordinariness it holds attention offers admirable performances and engenders emotional involvement as few recent movies have with only six months of the year gone there are now two memorable meaningful worthwhile films in theaters the other of course being sara polleys away from her  hollywood might have turned evening into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of real life mothers and daughters vanessa redgrave and natasha richardson and meryl streep and mamie gummer richardson is redgraves daughter in the film with a sister played by tony collette and gummer plays streeps younger self while redgraves youthful incarnation is claire danes add glenn close eileen atkins hugh dancy patrick wilson and a large cast yes it could have turned into a multiple star platform instead koltai the brilliant hungarian cinematographer of mephisto and director of fateless created a subtle ensemble work with a continental feel the story taking place in a high society newport environment in the days leading up to a wedding that is fraught with trouble missed connections wrong choices and dutiful compliance with social and family pressures present quite a soap opera but the quality of the writing koltais direction and selfless acting raise evening way above that level into the the rarified air of english french and a few american family sagas from a century before its contemporary setting complex relationships between mothers and daughters between friends and lovers with the addition of a difficult triangle all come across clearly understandably captivatingly individual tunes are woven into a symphony and yet with the all the foregoing emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances the stars of evening still shine through redgrave richardson gummer an exciting new discovery looking vaguely like her mother but a very different actress danes carrying most of the load until streep shows up in the final moments and of course steals the show dancy and wilson are well worth the price of admission too as with away from her evening stays with you at length inviting a re thinking its story and characters and re experiencing the emotions it raises at two hours the film runs a bit long but the way it stays with you thereafter is welcome among the many movies that go cold long before your popcorn
i sit through movies like tiempo de valientes and i want to talk about cinema for hours the admiration this movie caused me is beyond my own limits of explanation because i am watching the scenes of the film and i search inside my thoughts for film making ideas and dialogue innovations that could emerge from something bigger than damian szifrons mind looking the environment so uncompromised so simple i am thinking this man is a genius no wonder he created what is probably the best television show argentina ever witnessed and then a first movie full of elements some contemporary directors have not still achieved el fondo del mar is the name and it awakened a few years ago my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema starting his journey from peoples daily real lives szifron goes where pablo trapero never could in el bonaerense the federal police departments life traperos film was a journey into a mans mind and experiences not into the places he saw yes there was a detailed training and lots of crime situations but szifron in in there his is more of a detective story like the ones we know and love with the mysteries and the thrilling music but there is a lot of humanity in his writing and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters alfredo díaz and mariano silverstein there are a lot of actors of great caliber in the film but these two actors are the ones the film can not do without the first character luis luque is a detective that has just found out his wife cheats on him and has to work on a case the second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of the detective he wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the sheriff takes advantage of the time disposition and suggests he joins díaz in his routines it is nothing the usual stuff no problem but it is bigger than that and it will unfold a part of the doctors personality he did not know the relationship developed between the two leads can not be explained unless it is observed because it regards such a complexity that demonstrates how talented are some men like szifron that are trying today to leave a signature in our history reaching points of unbelievable spontaneity during a high pressure situation díaz tells silverstein how do we continue our treatment and silverstein answers no i am not your doctor you call me to have dinner i am your friend we laugh because we can not help it and we can not help laughing when díaz crashes a car in the street and does not gives importance to it or when he trespasses all the red lights in the street or when he smokes pot in his police patrol and silverstein can not believe it but then smokes it too because he is screwed up or when silverstein tries to be friendly with díazs robber friends magic from diego peretti is what we receive there he a psychiatrist himself gives a performance in plan locas de amor but impresses with all his range luis luque on the other hand is back on track with a top notch portrayal that reminds us the great actor he is there is a passion i have for this and as i said i could write about it for hours but unfortunately that is not the way it works and i have to be precise and summarize although i have to watch a lot of the old movies and study them i could assure that tiempo de valientes is the comedy argentina had been waiting for and never got
north africa in the 1930s to a small arab town on the edge of the sahara comes a beautiful woman looking for meaning to her life  a handsome trappist monk fleeing from his crisis of faith they will meet and passions will be stirred but not even the sand diviner knows if they will find happiness or sorrow here in the garden of allah the plot is pure hokum but the film is still great fun  beautiful to look at marlene dietrich  charles boyer are a superb screen couple she is to put it simply gorgeous and boyer gives a most effective understated performance letting his sensitive face do much of his acting for him the supporting cast is excellent basil rathbone in a sympathetic role as a count who loves the desert joseph schildkraut as a friendly talkative guide all the arabic he  others speak in the film is pure gibberish lucile watson as a gentle mother superior alan marshal as an honorable young french officer tilly losch as a dangerous dancer henry brandon as a comic porter john carradine as the mysterious sand diviner and magnificent sir c aubrey smith as a wise old priest movie mavens will recognize helen jerome eddy as a nun marcia mae jones  bonita granville peeking over the nuns shoulder as convent girls gaunt nigel de brulier as a monastery lector and ferdinand gottschalk as a hotel clerk all uncredited color films of the 1930s are both rare  lovely to look at and this movie is no exception the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself the garden of allah was the first technicolor film to be shot on location yuma arizona gave the film makers all the sand dunes they could desire but contaminated drinking water  135 degree heat soon had the company in revolt when the daily rushes showed boyers face had burned a bright tomato red producer david of selznick finally gave in the remainder of the film was shot on a hollywood sound stage
an excellent documentry i personally remember this growing up in nyc in the early 80s this movie is for anyone that was not around during that time period this shows the one thing the african american gay underclass felt was solely theirs and the love and camadrie you see is real the people are real and sadly few are still alive as this is being written the balls are still held but not to the extent that they were in the the nineteen eighties that time is gone forever this is a good pre homo thug movie when queens were really proud to be extroverts goodbye to storyville this is another era gone but greatly documented all hail film
the h g wells classic has had several incarnations the 05 speilburg version and the classic 53 version but only this one stays completely true to the book nothing is changed nothing is removed originally released as a 3 hour film the director re cut the film down to 2 hours of pure excellence its got a chapter by chapter visualization of the novels pages that wells would be proud of the story is as everyone remembers martians invade the earth with capsules containing an army of tripod walking war machines the people of 19th century earth are ill prepared to repel the alien forces and fight back with canons and guns who mes shells bound right off the walkers and when humanity is no longer a world wide power they are saved by the smallest of organisms on earth the film is an excellent accomplishment for director timothy hines who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a meager 5 million budget today b movies have larger budgets
it is one of the better indian movies i have seen lately instead of crappy song and dance or slum dog movies all the actors have showed the right emotions at the right intensity with right timing it is the hallmark of a good movie that it make the viewer go back and research the subject which exactly what i did checking on harilal i always enjoy akshay khannas subtle style of acting and interestingly he had rather a complicated relationship with his own father vinod khanna albeit not as dramatic as gandhis and wonder how it helped him essay this character i was impressed by the direction and 2 thumbs up for anil kapoor for producing such a classy movie
caught the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable movie channels and was so intrigued i sought out the next showing i really did not know what to expect after reading the program summary but i came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed it also gave me as adult who attended high school in the 80s a little better insight into what our kids have to contend with these days the fact that you do not see the shooting only adds to the chillness of the plot to see both child and adult alike struggle to comprehend and come to terms with the senseless shootings was at times overwhelming and will admit that i she would quite a few tears throughout on the whole not a movie that i would seek out to what however i am sure glad i did see it
a great bugs bunny cartoon from the earlier years has bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store after he is done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he will be transferring soon bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals animals like say a certain rabbit this causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer i found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early 1940s it still remains as funny nearly 60 years later this animated short can be seen on disc 1 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2 my grade a
after the usual chase scene jerry accidentally winds up inside a bottle of invisible ink which was part of a chemistry set he quickly discovers he is invisible so the predictable results occur meaning he uses his new hidden condition to torment tom jerry often is just defending himself but often he has sadistic streak in him that torments the cat whenever possible even when unprovoked here he makes tom think his eyes are deceiving him when cheese from a mousetrap disappears before his eyes or milk from a dish tom can not take anymore so he tries to sleep this nightmare off but jerry sets fire to his paw man i hope little kids did not ideas watching these cartoons back in the 40s and 50s i always found jerry the little mouse more evil than cute thankfully in cartoons generally whatever damage a character suffers is gone within seconds and he is back to normal the best part of this cartoon is about two thirds of the way through when tom figures out what the story is with jerry and tries different methods to detect where the mouse is located such as putting flour on the floor to see his footprints
this is a comedy of morals so occasionally a gentle touch of bitterness occurs but a lightness soften all sarcasm and irony flows till all of a sudden one moment will halt your heart and changes everything this film marvelously written and directed is a gem that shines perfectly with beautiful acting by all jean louis trintignant is exquisite as usual and romy schneider is a pearl perfect and glowing that is not to be missed a truly wonderful film 
the 60s is a great moviei saw it completely in one night about the hippy movement in the late 60s although the title would suggest otherwise the first 5 years of the 60s are not really important in this film the main character of the movie is michaela political activist who goes on the road in the us against the vietnam war there he meets his girlfriendsarah michaels brotherbriangoes to vietnam to fightwhat a surprise he comes back from the war and changes in a tom cruise born on the fourth of july look a like and then into a hippy his dad is a pro vietnam war type of guywhat a surprise michaels sister kate gets pregnant from a rock  roll artist and runs away from home and goes to san francisco during the summer of love the ending is very poorfather becomes a liberal and everybody is happybut i let this slip away from my votethe rest of the movie is very good the performances by the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant all the main events of the sixties are in the movielike the murders on jfk and martin luther king aswell as the big hippy proteststhe summer of love and woodstock look closely for wavywoodstock speakergravywhat we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400 000 as a first aid employee at the woodstock festivalin the endthe 60s is a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade 1010
mitchell leisens fifth feature as director and he shows his versatility by directing a musical after his previous movies were heavy dramas he also plays a cameo as the conductor you can tell it is a pre code movie and nothing like it was made in the us for quite a while afterwards like 30 years leisen shot the musical numbers so they were like what the audience would see no widescreen shots or from above ala busby berkeley what i do find funny or interesting is that you never actually see the audience as others have mentioned the leads are fairly characterless and jack oakie and victor mclaghlan play their normal movie personas gertrude michael however provides a bit of spark the musical numbers are interesting and some good the rape of the rhapsody in particular is amusing but the drama unconvincing and faked three murders is too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters this is where this movie could have been a lot better
i had been looking forward to how to lose friends  alienate people for months particularly due to the fact that kirsten dunst and simon pegg were starring simon pegg is a comedic genius and kirsten dunst has always been a favorite actress of mine how to lose friends  alienate people hit the spot of course not perfect but very enjoyable and funny how to lose friends  alienate people follows the life of sidney young a smalltime bumbling british celebrity journalist who is hired by an upscale magazine in new york city in spectacular fashion sidney enters high society and burns bridges with bosses peers and superstars after disrupting one black tie event by allowing a wild pig to run rampant sidney catches the attention of clayton harding editor of sharp and accepts a job with the magazine in new york city clayton warns sidney that he would better impress and charm everyone he can if he wants to succeed instead sidney instantly insults and annoys fellow writer alison olsen kirsten dunst he dares to target the star clients of power publicist eleanor johnson gillian anderson he also upsets his direct boss lawrence maddox danny huston sidney finds creative ways to annoy nearly everyone his saving grace a rising starlet sophie maes megan fox who develops an odd affection for him in time allisons friendship might be the only thing saving sydney from his downward spiraling career the storyline is very interesting and the acting was top notch with what the actors were given simon pegg is still hilarious as ever he makes sydney bumbling obnoxious and annoying as real as it gets but later in time making sydney not just likable but also a real character who you root for in the end kirsten dunst and jeff bridges were brilliant kirsten had some very wonderful acting and hilarious scenes and jeff bridges is just jeff fcking bridges how can you not like him he makes clayton a very humorous character with some wit and overall you just love the guy gillian anderson megan fox and danny huston were great as the supporting cast each had their own personality that were overall pretty unlikable but that is what just made the film work one thing i did not enjoy was how one dimensional some of the characters were i understand that most were the supporting cast but some of the cast was underused and could have given the film some more spice to it how to lose friends  alienate people will never be on anyones top 10 films ever or even top 10 comedies ever but it has a very high entertainment level and some scenes may even charm you as well how to lose friends  alienate people is definitely one of the better romantic comedies of the year 810
this short is a puzzlement words fail me here as this is almost indescribable technically exceptional after more than 90 years the visuals are remarkable and even occasionally amazing this is not something you watch if you like things that are mundane or normal because it most certainly is not either this be an odd one gang well worth checking out but if things like ren and stimpy make your head hurt you may want to skip this recommended
this is te cartoon that should have won instead of country cousin visually well done and much more entertaining and memorable worth watching just for the music alone although there are elements that undoubtably will bruise the sensibilities of some these days the cartoon has to be given a bit of perspective it is over sixty years old and it is after all just a cartoon i am disabled and if i were as hyper sensitive as the folks who look at things like this cartoon and take umbrage i would have long since curled up in a fetal position and faded away sometimes you need to lighten up put your head back and float caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering bing crosby reportedly hated it when he was used on more than one occasion sigh
this film seems to be well remembered as the time tom  jerry signed a peace treaty things are idyllic for a time but predictably it goes sour probably the most memorable moment was the endless fight involving a pipe a frying pan and a baseball bat that the two plus butch the dog engage in at the beginning and end of the short i enjoyed one a bunch and you should try to catch it on cartoon network
this is so exciting after i saw la roue this afternoon a short light hearted little movie i consider this one a real treat this is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures i saw this year it is the more amazing since it is an early talkie and puts some great pictures of the 30s to shame due to its innovative use of sound in cinema it is simply filled with music and an adorable mood that is really upbeat and bottom line it made me happy obviously it would not be so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket the male lead was looking for but the pace is so exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that i did not even think of it twice the comedy is many times hilarious and i think it is even superior to the marx brothers possibly the biggest comedic force of the time this is rather perfect
i was not sure when i heard about this coming out i was thinking how dumb is disney getting i was wrong i found it to be very good i mean it is not the lion king but it is cool to see another side from a certain point it was very funny also it was not one of those corny disney sequels were the animation sucks it was just like the lion king animation the only thing that eritated me was the whole movie theater thing through out the movie not to give anything way but you will know what i am talking about i also fun that it was cool to have most of the cast from the original to return it was a very good movie over all
tommy jones and matt dillon do the gambling world proud the various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself there are a few surprises as cynical as we are today i fully expected the good girl to be crying over his grave instead of his buddys especially with her remarks about going to the funeral of her best friend when she first meets matt and then of course you expect matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in mr allens face blinding him interesting role by bruce dern wrrrooonnnnggg some of the other hollywood endings do happen but the writing is so excellent the acting so carefully wrought that you are blissfully unaware and the music is out of this world taking us back to the 50s when our native passions were first being unleashed by the music of ray charles and bo diddley even a little racism raring its ugly head in chicago but at a club called wonderfully biloxi with a confederate flag backing up the racist remarks i will be watching it again just to hear the music good thing i have the factotum sound track so i can listen to that in the car watch both together and you will see how matt has matured playing bar room characters in both now that he owns a bar in the paramount hotel in nyc he probably has great opportunity to do his studies great actor just coming into his own he shows finely nuanced performances the good and the bad in his characters his young boy off the farm is a great study made especially poignant because of his bassett hound eyes he makes love convincingly as well since he was in several movies with diane lane as a teen ager i wonder how that it making love to an actress you kind of grew up with adds conviction i will say that
man on fire tells a story of an ex special forces guy with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in mexico during the wave of kidnappings for ransom at first he is not to friendly but then they befriend with each other he decides to stop drinking etc  etc then one day she gets kidnapped and killed and he will not stop at anything to get the revenge that is basically the story of man on fire but expect some big twists at least a few times including the ending which is beautiful and will probably make you cry that is also because of the great music harry gregson williams with lisa gerrard gladiator composed but the strongest part of the movie wait the thing is everything here is perfect first acting denzel washington is at his best mickey rourke and christopher walken good as always great radtha mitchell and amazing young dakota fanning and that is not the end of the list then come the cinematography which is dazzling and along with superb editing should have won an oscar for sure the story is not just a revenge movie the story is intelligent the story makes you think and is pure beautiful really this is one of those movies you need to see in your lifetime at least once
this movie has a great messagea impressive cast ellen burstyn samantha mathis jodelle ferland was 4 years old when she made this movie ellen burstyn and jodelle ferland have both been nominated for best actress in a tv drama at the up coming emmy awards in new york peter masterson director has been nominated best director tv drama at the emmy awards also april 1 2001 jodelle ferland won best actress in a tv drama at the young artist awards in studio city ca i can see why they have 3 nominations mermaid is a true story during the cridits they have the real family on the set something you do not see often you can find mermaid at all blockbuster video stores do watch ityou will be glad you did
house of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part a psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators you are never sure of who is exactly who in this movie this is both a quality and a drawback of the script as the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency but all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development this is definitely one of the best movies about gambling
first off i am not some justin timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good in fact i am not even a huge justin fan but i did like this movie i work at a video store and when i saw this movie with its huge cast that i would never even heard of i had to see what it was about i did not find justins acting that bad it was clearly the worst out of the group but it is a pretty impressive group with cary elwes and dylan mcdermott being two names that did not even make the first credits list the story is basic a journalist uncovering corrupt cops but i found it well done l l cool js character was clearly conflicted but i honestly did not know what he would do in the end morgan freeman is as always the wise mentor figure he does so well and as much as i love kevin spacey he was kind of just there his character did not have a whole lot of substance but it is kevin spacey he can do no wrong surprisingly i thought dylan mcdermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop truly believable and really in character he freaked me out a couple of times i was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest horrible catchphrases unjustified action sequences stuff like that but it was surprisingly well done and i did not find any of that every shooting had a point it was not clichéd pretty solid really overall amazing cast decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump i do not know why it did not appear in theatres it was better than some garbage i have seen on the big screen i would say it is worth seeing
a well made and imaginative production refreshingly free from cliché this somewhat picaresque affair recounts a tale of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal conditions the man an escaped convict who has kidnapped the youth for his value as a hostage expertly directed by alan gibson with a fine sense for balanced narrative movement the film provides freshness in nearly every scene as felon martin steckert richard harris believing that his rejection for parole was particularly undeserved contrives a convoluted but ultimately successful escape plan following which his spontaneous nature comes to the fore as he flees to the lakeside residence of his childhood often bursting into song or dancing a few steps the capricious steckert gradually gains the trust and affection of his captive and as police close in for an inevitable showdown the tethered pair are seen to be a great deal alike in their responses to forms of rejection as discerned by a psychiatrist lindsay wagner assigned to aid a zealous police lieutenant james coburn who is in charge of the manhunt for steckert and his prisoner this is an engrossing story worth telling a quickly paced and novel adventure that profits from a capital performance by harris fine turns from wagner coburn and karen black along with justin henry as the snatched lad with an appropriately whimsical score contributed by wilfred josephs and top notch cinematography by frank watts with all footage shot in a beautiful autumnal ontario province
first off i would like to make a correction on another review of this film which said that the last musical to win the best picture academy award was gigi in 1958 that is misinformation as west side story won in 1962 my fair lady won in 1965 and sound of music won the year after that that said this film is absolutely fantastic the story from the novel has been somewhat altered but that is more because of the limitations that they had on a stage that they just did not change back for a filmed version however i do not mind in fact i rather think the whole production flows better than the novel does i like nancy bringing oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment the subtle things in this film are the ones that make me laugh i love the moment mr bumble and mrs bumble start coming out at the beginning from the governors office the underscore for that moment is brilliant my three favorite actors for this film were jack wild who plays the best dodger in any film version of the story ron moody a playful and humorous fagin this character is worked out much better than he is in the book and shani wallis who is the strongest most distressed version of nancy the only reason i am giving this film a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers which are concider yourself and who will buy  i always hate when the choreography in musicals in meant to look like people doing everyday chores and jobs it looks awful and cheesy especially when they are dancing at the london meat co they should have just done regular choreography for these scenes however this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us hopefully forever
i was never a big fan of television until i watched 24 for the first time i got into the series very late season 5 ended before i even saw my very first episode it was an episode of series 3 that was on my parents dvr digital video recorder box while i was house sitting for the weekend it took that one episode for me to be hook line and sinker into the world of jack bauer and boy was i hooked i watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye the next day i went to blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month pass for twenty something dollars and needless to say it has been the greatest blockbuster money i have ever spent i watched the first three seasons in three weeks that is 72 forty minute episodes i will say that finding out what happens next is easier on dvd than waiting an entire week i can only imagine the anticipation of watching season 6 week to week i find it mildly torturous and cruel but i am going to give it a try and watch it just like the rest of america the dvr is set and you can bet i will be chomping at the bit
a very strange and compelling movie it is about a very awkward and tightly wound man who attempts to navigate his life as a door to door fundraisersalesman the director was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served the story well original and unsettling while also finding a great deal of humor in the pain that accompanies life there is a sequence at a testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something i do as frequently as i should one of the more memorable films i have seen in a long while has not left my mind and i look forward to future efforts by bronstein fantastic performances all around the simple line i really appreciate it  is now iconic to me
this is certainly one of my all time fav episodes of trek there is just so much going on in this one film that its crazy cool first the guys beam down to an alien planet that is about to explode they meet a freaky librarian type dude very well played then kirk manages to get himself transported back to what is very much like 16th century earth mccoy and spock try to follow but instead nearly freeze to death on the frozen version of the alien world 100000 years in the past kirk manages to get himself locked up and charged with witchcraft while spock enjoys some amok time with a sexy cavegirl who was vanquished to the this frozen awful world by some bad guy spock decides hes happy where hes at and gives mccoy a royal assestment whuppin when the doc suggests they need to look for a way out anyhowthey all finally escape leaving the poor cavegirl behind it takes a ton of convincing before spock finally gives in and leaves you can literally taste the sadness at the end leaving the cavegirl all alone in her frozen wasteland just seems cruel and is really touching spock must have been out of his vulkin mind to leave behind his greatest hope for love and being human albeit in a not so nice neighborhoodanyway you just get so much bang for your buck with this episode a love story the salem witch trials spock as a human the desperation of being left in total isolation abandoned and three entirely different settings on the alien planet its amazing they managed to jam all this into one fifty minute film this one is a classic do not miss it i want it on dvd fer shure vulcans
enjoyed the movie and efficient confucian crime drama the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man no doubt representing modern society i thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big d was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long i loved the scene and for once in a chinese movie the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest on thing that always amuses me about hk films is that the main influence the british seem to have had is to introduce yes sir and sorry into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone they are still there
this movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents can regretfully watch with their mostly entertained little kids the movie seems and is mostly geared towards children yet it does not stop on this level i watched this movie first as a young child and found it to be funny entertainingand heartwarming and did not see it again for several years i watched it again recently at age 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining this movie is highly underrated and contains many messages of real life this movie is an inspirational quest story that is made for kids yet epic in its own right i recommend this movie to anyone of any age
steve carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy first on the daily show and then in various supporting roles in virgin carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths carell plays andy stitzer a middle aged man living a quiet lonely life andy is a little odd but in an awkward nice guy sort of way one night while socializing with his co workers for the first time andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin his co workers david paul rudd jay romany malco and cal seth rogen initially tease andy about his situation but it is clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that andy is and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity and so begins andys quest into adulthood andy is the quintessential innocent and the bulk of the humor derives from his naiveté to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film some of the humor is crude gross out stuff but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy in addition i found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life i am not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama it is a rolling in your seats comedy still every good comedy i have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters a good comparison would be the wedding crashers from earlier this summer virgin has a similar humor but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes i particularly loved the ending of the film which i thought was a perfect way to end the flick without giving anything away it reminded me of something about mary very light and fun it leaves you laughing and smiling which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy i would highly recommend
if like me you like your films to be unique and unlike the majority of other movies then i wholly recommend that you check out the beast the film is a grotesque erotic fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological beast that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a french mansion and lusts after women the film is very daring with it is subject material and that is something to give it credit for the theme of bestiality is a definite taboo and for good reason i might add but the film conveys it straight and to the point like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre the beast could have gone around it and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps but borowczyk did not do that and he is brave in that respect especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms but the fact that he went ahead with it in my view means a big thumbs up for the guy the film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female this opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience in some ways for the incredible tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see the scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking and are bound to offend many people hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years but these scenes are not merely an excuse for borowczyk to shock the viewer this film has a defining point as said during the film the only difference between man and beast is intelligence both man and beast have instincts only man knows how to control them the beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire and it is only when the central female character let us go of her control that she can see the beast the film has strong themes of the age old story of beauty and beast weaved into it and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust but not without a moral many criticise the scenes around the films shocking sex sequences for being boring but these scenes are important to the films story without these scenes we would not get to know the characters or the story of the beast and most importantly the story of beauty and the beast would not be able to have it is horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience and as that is one of the key elements of the film it would be a real shame besides that borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes not with shocks but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family along with the beautiful shots of the mansions ground would not be seen and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either overall the beast is a shocking film it is portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone however if you can get over the films shock and embrace the beast what awaits is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance
i would like to comment the series as a great effort the story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well especially in season 1 season 2 however became more of a freak show and lost das original charm season one story line was more interesting a light side to the life at jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the x series i was looking forward to new seasons in fact i still am i hope the fox guys and da production crew realize that a lot of ppl still wait for da to make a comeback even after 2 yrs of it being cancelled da can make it big if worked on properly and i think a name like james cameron should take on this challenge
one night i stumbled upon this on the satellite station bravo initially out of curiosity i decided to watch it to be perfectly honest i was not disappointed the main character is beautiful and her body is shown off well you would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently not after watching the whole filmmy only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays melnik christ its badthe prison guard hank is woeful too all he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his co guard wanda though fortunately for us the viewer and for hank he gets down and dirty with wanda near the end the music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions this movie is well watching alone for the beautifultalented and very sexy jennifer thomas
the film maybe goes a little far but if you love the show it is what you expect it is not a bad movie it is actually pretty good if you do not like the show do not see the movie it starts off a little slow maybe but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny there are even a few heart wrenching scenes toward the end after all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you also jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his shows existience he is got a pretty good point we care so much about the private details of celebrities lives so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national tv too if they were celebrities we would not mind at all we would eat it up do we not like his guest doing this just because they are poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a leave it to beaver world
i happened upon this film by accident and really enjoyed timothy busfields character is without redeeming qualities and at one point busfield and star meloni ogle women as they pass by melonis take on the parade is different from busfields janel maloney is terrific she looks very much like tea leone but the major difference here is that janel can actually act some very nice things in this film and well worth your attention when it is on cable
sure it was well shot and made very well shot and made but the story was just so weak and the portrayal of lincoln was even weaker not that henry fonda was not good but the character he played was nothing but a loon do you mean to tell me that lincoln was a wise cracking smart ass with no respect of the law or the court i mean who the hell was he supposed to be cousin vinnie i mean come on i will just call you jackass then i understand that ford was going for great funny hero guy but i did not really like this guy at all he cheats in sports talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom how am i supposed to take this seriously the twist was even weaker i mean come on that was just stupid the whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams saying that i liked it enough it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so i can not say it is a bad film in fact i must say that i must say it is good enough nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad but this vivid and silly story was just so ridiculous that i can not understand how anyone could consider it great i have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true i would really have to shake my head
heartland is a wonderful depiction of what it was really like to live on the frontier the hard work and individual strength that were needed to survive the hardships of the climate and the lack of medical care are blended with the camaraderie and the interdependence of the settlers the drama was especially meaningful because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there it was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people no one was glamorous or looked as if they had just spent a session with the makeup or costume department conchatta ferrell is just wonderful she is an example of the strong persevering people who came to wyoming in the early 20th century and let no hardship stand in their way of a new life in a new land
i saw the film twice in the space of one week both times the at a cinema in orpington kent uk the place was packed both times and people had to be turned away from the start of the film with henry winkler getting injured on the football field the whole audience was in uproar with laughter laughter that lasted until the credits for those who love american wrestling this film is a must but be ready to see henry winkler as you have never seen him before also look out for a very well known actor whose trademark wrestling move is a head butif you get a chance watch this movie and it is family comedy entertainment at its best
this is not so bad that it is good it is purely good for those who do not understand why you have the intellect of a four year old in response to a certain comment  anyways killer tomatoes eat france is a parody of itself a parody of you and a parody of me it is the single most genius text in cinematic history i have it and the three prequels sitting on my dvd rack next to herzog and kurosawa it embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard i write scripts and this movie single handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me the likes of which we have never seen it can only be taken in portions its sort of exploitive by now i am just trying to take up the ten line minimum my comment ended a while ago hopefully it works when i submit it now
every great gangster movie has under currents of human drama do not expect an emotional story of guilt retribution and despair from scarface this is a tale of ferocious greed corruption and power the darker side of the fabled american dream anybody complaining about the cheesiness of this film is missing the point the superficial characters cheesy music and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess nothing in the lives of these characters really matter not on any human level at least in fact the film practically borderlines satire ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of tony montana this is not brian depalmas strongest directorial effort it is occasionally excellent and well handled particularly the memorable finale but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled thankfully it is supported by a very strong script by oliver stone probably good therapy for him considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time the themes are consistent with the focus primarily on the life of tony montana and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power the dialogue is also excellent see sawing comfortably between humour and drama there are many stand out lines which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another the cast help make it what it is as well but this is really pacinos film one of his earlier less subtle performances something much more common from him nowadays this is a world entirely separate from michael corleone and frank serpico yet he is as watchable here as ever in very entertaining and intentionally over the top form it is hard to imagine another tony montana after seeing this film in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing but i have come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife not an exceptional effort but unfairly misjudged the supporting players are very good too particularly paul shenar as the suave alejandro sosa powerful occasionally humorous sometimes shocking and continually controversial scarface is one of the films of the eighties whatever that might mean to you an essential and accessible gangster flick and a pop culture landmark 910
this movie was the best movie i have ever seen being lds i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone i saw this movie with my family and i can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with after i saw this moviethere was not a single dry eye in the entire room everyone was touched by what they saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it i highly recommend this movie for everyone
beautiful film pure cassavetes style gena rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress dealing with success aging loneliness and alcoholism she tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts embodied by the death spectre of a young girl acceptance of oneself of human condition though its overall difficulties is the real purpose of the film the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling it is like if the stage became a way out for the heroin if all american movies could only be that top quality dealing with human relations on an adult level not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings one of the best dramas ever 1010
sure it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny but at least the filmmakers did not try while most tv movies border on the brink of mediocrity this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it the cinematography was pretty good for a tv film and viggo mortensen displays shades of aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy but the scene with the mountain lion was intense i was kind of annoyed by jason priestlys role in the film as a rebellious shock jock but then again it is a tv movie despite all of the good things the soundtrack was atrocious however it was nice to see tucson arizona prominently featured in the film
for a movie with a plot like this i would normally smell tearjerker in the first ten minutes and turn it off but this was very well made with emotional subtleties great acting and some genuinely funny moments it was also interesting to see a different culture a vanishing one at that my wife and i both dug it
a meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that long ago used to terrorize the area around crater lake as the monster eats the locals they try and find away of killing the monster recent attempts at sending up old horror and science fiction films like lost skeleton of cadavra and alien trespass are kind of rendered moot when you have films like crater lake monster available for screening it is the sort of film that those films spoof and send up only this is the real deal its everything those films try to be only with out the tongue in cheek and its so much more fun because of it this is a real drive in sort of film that had the unfortunate luck of coming just as star wars changed the way we look at special effects the monster a mix of stop motion and a life size head is a charmingly quaint little beast the filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its mayhem sure its clear that its all fake but is not movies about suspension of disbelief actually i think its about really cool monsters which this has i like this movie in a low budget drive in sort of a way if you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no farther this would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films boggy creek etc 
while it certainly was not the best movie i have ever seen it was certainly worth the 8 which can not be said for many movies these days this was a pleasant account of a true story although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the movie ie billy sundays character was three or four people in the real story combined together  robert deniro was of course good and cuba gooding jr  was also impressive
i just recently watched this 1954 movie starring vincent price for the first time on turner classic movies price portrays don gallico a magicianinventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions and also his wife portrayed in a brief role by the lovely eva gabor even though price is a murderer i actually found myself rooting for him he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him although this movie does not have the horror factor of some of his more famous roles such as my favorite house of wax it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest this is a must for vincent price fans
starlift is a pleasant and interesting throwback to those all star musical pictures that every studio was putting out during the world war ii years when you have got such stars as gary cooper james cagney doris day gordon macrae and randolph scott etc  in the film and with such people as the gershwin brothers cole porter jule styne and sammy cahn supplying the music it is an easy to take film and the plot is not even in the way what plot there is involves two air force enlisted men dick wesson and ron hagerthy trying to meet warner brothers starlet janice rule using as a gimmick the fact that both come from youngstown ohio and hagerthys father was rules dentist as well as half of the towns the scheme works too well as louella parsons is soon putting them as an item in her column yes louellas in the film as well she must have liked warner brothers or jack warner catered to her more than the other studio bosses because she also used this studio to publicize her hollywood hotel radio program back in the day but the rest of the plot also touched on the real life efforts of ruth roman also playing herself to get her studio and others to do shows at the air force bases for the servicemen and women going to korea some of the names i have mentioned and others sing and perform in a show at travis air force base where a lot of this film was shot one specialty number was shot for the talents of phil harris who singnarrates a ballad look out stranger i am a texas ranger aided and assisted by virginia gibson frank lovejoy and gary cooper yup cooper looked like he was having a great old time kidding his image this is the oldest of clichés when you say they do not make them like this any more but they really do not because you do not have a studio system that has all this talent under contract that is one thing about the demise of the old studio system we can mourn
antonio margheritis danza macabra aka castle of blood of 1964 is a beautiful and incredibly haunting masterpiece of italian gothic horror and after mario bavas la maschera del demonio aka black sunday of 1960 and roger cormans pit and the pendulum of 1961 starring the great vincent price another must see that earned the wonderful barbara steele her more than deserved fame as the most important female horror icon in the history of motion pictures but not only is the beautiful and brilliant barbara steele one of my favorite actresses of all time the screenplay to danza macabra was co written by no one less than the cinematic genius sergio corbucci who directed such ingenious spaghetti western milestones as django 1966 and the great silence 1968 italys number 2 in the field right after mario bava director antonio margheriti is one of the all time masters of gothic horror and castle of blood is doubtlessly his greatest achievement hardly another film works so brilliantly in creating an incredibly haunting yet beautiful atmosphere as it is the case with this creepy masterpiece when he encounters the famous writer of brilliant macabre stories edgar allen poe in a gloomy london tavern young journalist alan foster georges rivière accepts a bet from a nobleman that he can not spend a night in his haunted castle in the night of all souls eve as soon as foster enters the eerie castle mysterious things start to happen after a little while however he encounters an enchanting resident of the castle the stunningly beautiful elisabeth blackwood barbara steele the mysterious events so far however have only been forebodings of the terrors the castle bears however the eerie castle setting alone would be sufficient to create a gloomy mood the excellent black and white cinematography and a great score by riz ortolani create an incredibly haunting atmosphere that is eerie beyond comparison the wonderful barbara steele is fantastic as always i simply can not find enough words to praise this wonderful actress no other actress has ever been capable of uniting ravishing beauty with the uncanny as it is the case with steele and no actress ever will besides steele the movies cast contains another stunning beauty margarete robsahm and she also delivers a great performance george rivières performance as alan foster is great and the rest of the performances are also very good castle of blood is outstanding in many departments barbara steele delivers one of her best performances the cinematography and locations are beautifully haunting beyond comparison the atmosphere is incredibly eerie the film simply is a perfect whole of atmosphere gothic beauty and the art of terror in short castle of blood is one of the most atmospheric and greatest gothic horror films ever made and must not be missed by anyone interested in the genre 1010

this movie is bufoonery and i loved it the dragon lord jacky chan and his buddy cowboy totally made the movie fun meaningful and just plain silly the movie is a rare blend of a good vs evil fight and somehow the wonders and fun that is growing up long shao ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young dragon lord so named because he is the son of a wealthy family and cowboy which include implementing clever elaborate ways to escape studying with the help of the entire household including the tutor competing in rather boyish and idiotically interesting ways to gain the affection of a local girl competing in soccer you will see what i mean and the list goes on somehow they find themselves in the midst of a fight to save the a shipment of valuable antiques and the lives of several people the movie has its serious moments but they do not depress but rather inspire the playfulness of the boys are not lost in this exchange but is actually employed against evil what i really loved about this movie is how it ends not the typical confrontation which in itself was awesome but well you will see let me just say it truly captures the spirit of the movie silly witty meaningful and nostalgic great movie
i love jacks jokes like the cliché is  or over the top cliché guy black oily skin kind of spooky  he is just hilarious daniels starting to catch up on him to good thing jacks not on the team anymore in a way or else it would have been sarcasm maniai just love all the plots season 8 a little less i have to admit the characters are great the actors are great i am starting to pick up facial expressions and more from jack daniel and tealc it just all theoretically possible and exciting oops their i go again sorry i am also starting to pick up traits from carter and all of this is driving my parents nutz well to conclude i think it is good for another three seasons or so especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor drama action and so forth
this is definitely one of jets best efforts few actors are able to play the stoic as jet li can the action is rapid fire and special effects boosted for intensity purposes as a result it may take americans a little off guard a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a jet li film i feel that it is an excellent introduction to jets work and look forward to further masterpieces especially fist of legend making it into the us market a nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts
this was one of the highlights of sttngs semi forgettable second season before they grew up or grew into their own in the third season and beyond this was not only a showcase for up and comers like bill campbell and teri hatcher but was also the continuation of datas search for his humanity this time through the concept of comedy still one of my favorite episodes on a side note i am still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character okona was about to have a trystafter teri hatchers character before being rudely interrupted by lt worf i remember watching this episode first run at my friends comic shop back in the day and we all thought she would have been a perfect jean greymarvel girl it would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is
claire denis has demonstrated repeatedly that film does not need to tell a story that it is sufficient to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make of them what they will ostensibly the idea within the framework of a most non linear film is the older man living on the french swiss border a man devoted to his dogs who still has a lover but whose cardiac status increasingly threatens his life he has a son with a little family who infrequently meet with him but when he discovers he is in need of a heart transplant he opts for going to tahiti via japan to obtain a heart transplant on the black market and to rekindle a long lost relationship with a son he had form a tahitian women years ago what denis does with this outline of a story is use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul the vastness of nature mans interaction with people vs animals etc much of the time the film does not make sense but that is because we try too hard to connect all the dots laid out before us in beautiful pictures life is sort of like that we look see observe integrate process and make of it what we will in using this form of film making much as she did in the strangely beautiful beau travail claire denis has developed a signature technique whether or not the viewer finds the finished product rewarding has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information this is an interesting and visually captivating film but many viewers will find it an overly long discourse about very little perhaps watching again will change that grady harp
as if most people did not already have a jittery outlook on the field of dentistry this little movie will sure make you paranoid patients squirm a successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife going down on the pool man on their anniversary of all days and snaps big time into a furious breakdown after shooting an attack dogs head off he strolls into work and ends up taking his marital aggression out on the patients as he plans what to do about his slut of a wife there are plenty of up close shots of mouth jabbing tongue cutting and beauty queen fondling as well as a marvelously deranged performance by corbin bernsen the scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch a dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail the dentist is incredibly entertaining fast paced and laughably gory at times check it out
i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site i would have to say it was worth the effort however you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes if you do not have the staying power get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights now to the film what i say will contain spoilers and if you do not mind here goes alexandre is a promiscuous bum a womanizer and a gigolo he lives with an older woman called marie marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her at this point alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else by chance alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past marie and veronika struggles for alexs affection and had a ménage à trois to boot finally at the end it is revealed veronika is pregnant with alexs child and alex asked her to marry him we assume as aforesaid with gilbertes situation alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family there is hope with the title of la maman et la putain i deduce jean eustache was relating to françoise lebruns character of veronika she was a who are and then she became the mother hence the mother and who are is the same person anyway what do i know french films are mostly not all very chatty aimlessly political preaching theatrical insipid lamenting and full of quotes lebrun and léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed not a bad effort 710
what a loss the passing of director emile ardolino was he could take a light script and with the right casting and editing put a twinkle in it and make it shine like a star this particular star may not be the brightest in the sky as great romances go but it is definitely one that keeps you tuned in to the end you really want to know how things are going to work out the script is perfect for cybill shepherd who at the time needed to capitalize on her moonlighting success for the new generation who was fortunately for her probably unaware of how many big screen major duds she had after a very promising start in this film she is every bit back in form as a still pining widow living vicariously through her daughter mary stuart masterson on the cusp of stardom which would peak with fried green tomatoes two years later she may have looked too young for the role but that works well for the way the story unfolds this is her film but she does not overstep her bounds as a lead shepherd graciously allows robert downey jr to carry much of the film and shows a more mature comic flair than he had in his previous films to that point and there is ample support from ryan ofneal in his best role in years and christopher macdonald mastersons natural charm pretty much coasts on its own either that or she has a way of making her character seem like a breath of fresh air with every word ardolino makes good use of his casts sex appeal the same way he did with dirty dancing but this film is not quite as sizzling so you could still watch it with your parents if they happened to be in the room use your best judgment they are your parents after all  i give this film a high mark because it is very user friendly romantic comedy enthusiasts will find it sublime and those who are just watching along with them should find plenty of humor to enjoy as well again credit goes to emile ardolino for making the most of a charming script by randy and perry howze where are they now ardolinos next film would be the phoned in sequel to three men and a baby but his final theatrical release sister act would finally give him the nine figure grossing smash hit he deserved mr ardolino your cinematic touch is missed
i thought this move was very good there were a few things that were less than perfect but overall i was quite surprised the courtroom scene in the end seemed a little unrealistic but was real enough to be entertaining i found that the movie communicated the hardships of going though military training and the sacrifices that go along with it being a military pilot i could relate to many of these parts
i thought this movie was really really great helena did an amazing job in it i thought she played her character very well she is an awesome actress the movie was also really funny too the jokes were great i could not stop laughing i think everyone should see it 
this is a quirky little movie and i have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well it follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous las vegas illusionist and is partly about following his dream partly about the dreams of others and all about the travails of showbiz i thought the movie was charming and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhile alan arkin is terrific as the magician who never was and his mentoring of max makes for a funny and touching relationship not for everyone probably but if you like movies about the journey then i think you will like this one
this is a great example of a good dumb movie no it is not high art by any means nor is the script anywhere close to a woody allen or mel brooks but so what the killer tomatoes series four movies and a cartoon series are basically good natured romps gleefully trampling on the kind of territory the zuckers ruled before they switched to making serious flicks as the title suggests this fourth installment of the killer tomatoes trilogy deals with the killer tomatoes plot against france in this case professor gangrene john astins 3rd time in the role has a plan to rule france through an ancient prophecy about the return of the rightful king of france steve lundquist returns as igor a humanoid tomato who wants to be a sportscaster and who just happens to be a dead ringer for the long lost true king of france obviously he also plays the aforementioned l l t k of f happily skewering the french language opposing them is the fearless fuzzy tomato like the others ft was introduced in the second film and would be a main character in the cartoon and his human allies mark price recently unemployed as a result of the conclusion of the family ties series plays a thinly disguised version of himself passing himself as michael j fox as a way to win the girl of his dreams and angela visser is a dream as marie gleefully bouncing between unabashed virginal sexuality and borderline psychosis oh that the former miss netherlands had had more of a film career another returning member of the killer tomatoes stock company is rick rockwell now best known as the hapless title subject of who wants to marry a millionaire like co creator john de bello rockwell works both in front of and behind the camera in this series what can you say about jon de bello not much really except that he had a singular vision and managed to pull it off and having done that has apparently dropped into obscurity john if you ever see this thanks for giving us the killer tomatoes the script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie like return of the killer tomatoes the action occasionally veers off the set and into the middle of the film crew and mark price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack of success compared to his former costar michael j fox this is the biggest budgeted of all the killer tomatoes flicks and is a nice send off to the series okay the show then moved to fox kids as a cartoon series which was also quite clever but cartoons just are not the same
this was a must see documentary for me when i missed the opportunity in 2004 so i was definitely going to watch the repeat i really sympathised with the main character of the film because this is true i have a milder condition of the skin problem he had dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa eb this is a sad sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder jonny kennedy speaks like a kid because of wasting vocal muscle and never went through puberty but he is 36 years old most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition and pealing off his bandages jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin he tells his story with the help of his mother edna kennedy his older brother and celebrity model and jonnys supporter nell mcandrew it won the baftas for best editing and best new director factual and it was nominated for best sound factual and the flaherty documentary award it was number 10 on the 100 greatest tv treats 2004 a must see documentary
it would be easy to call guys and dolls great it is got frank sinatra and marlon brando and contrary to sinatras original wishes the casting works it is got a really cool 1950s feel even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption and most of the songs are often a lot of fun and catchy and performed with that wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself if it is not entirely as great as some others of its ilk it should not be any fault of the filmmaker joseph l mankiewicz not all the songs entirely click and a little of the dialog feels like it is being performed for the stage as opposed to film it is hard to tell at times brando and sinatra straddle the line so often that one has to watch carefully to tell when one plays for the camera or for the stage while the actress playing adele is better for stage than screen the plot is one of those winners that works well for its period even if one wonders if its influence has stretched to the likes of 1999s she is all that well not quite but close a gambler and 14 year betrothed played by sinatra wants to host a big time game but is told that the heat is on meaning the cops are on watch so he has only one choice to host the game with a thousand dollar tab the only way he can get it is through a big time bet with fellow gambler brando who is put on to make a wild wooing job of a mission worker it allows for the predictable twists in the story in the sudden turn on turn off of the charms of the character of the idiosyncrasies of people from the streets gangsters and dancers and the saitn played by jean simmons who falls for brando it is in its basic concept about this whole world of guys and dolls and how to balance one or the other obviously without getting married or too compromised mankiewicz brings a lot of energy to the piece even when keeping still with the camera on the subject and his stars are properly reeled in hell even brando works excellently for a musical as he goes beyond being simply the method actor and shows his chops for singing and big star quality the story and characters eventually wind down to what you would hope will happen and that is fine all we ask for and what we get is entertainment in good spurts of witty involving dialog and a few songs and dances that bring the house down my favorites were the number with the lady cats at the club luck be a lady and the two numbers down in havana cuba a
joe buck jon voight decides he is going to leave his small life in texas and make it big in the big city the women are there for the asking and the men are mainly tutti fruttis  wide eyed he comes to new york city not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences one worse than the other in the middle of that chaos he meets and befriends rico ratso rizzo dustin hoffmann a homeless looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building there is not much of a story as midnight cowboy is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only joe bucks plights in the city but also inter cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past his failed relationship with his girlfriend annie jennifer salt who was gang raped his abandonment by his mother and his apparent abuse by his grandmother who also had a habit of hustling men for money an air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery everybodys talking we feel that even while we want joe to eventually make his mark in the city the odds are high he will not and will end up working for pennies in a dead end job shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself we know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this a dark story of dashed hopes john schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s and at the center the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life there is the implied notion that they may have been lovers ratsos reaching out to hug joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this but this is essentially a buddy film one that manages to survive literally to the death and bring some form of hope to joe who at the end in florida seems much changed older wiser
as i am no fan of almost any post desperate living john waters films i warmed to pecker after he emerged from the underground waters produced trash lite versions of his earlier works cry baby polyester hairspray that to die hard fans looked and tasted like watered down liqueur pecker which does not attempt to regurgitate early successes is a slight quiet humble commentary on the vagaries of celebrity and the pretentiousness of the art world waters clearly knows this subject well because he has also exhibited and sold at ridiculous prices some of the most amateurish pop art ever created that you could not imagine anyone being able to give away if it was not emblazoned with the waters name edward furlong is fine as pecker and waters non histrionic style is at ease with the subject
one of my favorite scenes is at the beginning when guests on a private yacht decide to take an impromptu swim in their underwear rather risqué for 1931
i do not know why some people criticise that show so much it is a great funny show probably not the right material for mainstream prime time but still the family dynamics are funny and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent siegfried  roy jibes are only just above average but ever so often you have sub plots or one liners that make you roll on the floor laughing this show was well worth the 8 pounds i paid for it rating 810
it was in 1988 when i saw the ronnie and nancy show for the first time on austrian television at that time i was already a very big fan of spitting image since when it won the bronze rose of the montreux film festival in 1986 of course i recorded every show on tape and watched it again and again especially the ronnie and nancy show i remember that scene when ronnie stood in front of a painting of abraham lincoln thinking it was a mirror and said to himself i need a shave or most amusing of all when he played ball with his dog but vice versait is such a shame that spitting image seems to fall into oblivion it was one of the most fantastic and most intelligent made tv shows ever compared to other satirical broadcasts it was definitely the best of all well almost 20 years have passed since then and i wish i could see the show again is it possible to purchase it from someone somewhere
this was a superb episode one of the best of both seasons down right horror for a change with a story that is way way above the average moh episodes if there is such a thing a mans wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck in which he was driving his airbag worked hers did not she is burned beyond recognition great makeup btw and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft but even in a coma she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology and when she does die for a few minutes her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit carnage of course ensues and also some extremely gory killings and also some extremely sexy scenes what more could you ask for you might ask well not much because this baby has it all and a very satirical ending that should leave a smile on most viewers faces i just loved rob schmidts wrong turn direction too he has a great knack for horror excellent episode this is one i am buying for sure
the first of the official ghibli films laputa is most similar to its predecessor nausicaa but whereas nausicaa was a sf epic this is more of an action comedy adventure with a fairly weak sf premise for the first half hour of the movie i thought i was going to love it once again you find yourself in awe of miyazakis attention to detail and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous beautiful perfection the animation though still not in the league of the later ghibli films is a little better than in nausicaa i mentioned in my review of nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more lupinesque anime style here there are a whole bunch of them the pirates they provide the comic element in the film though quite why it needs a comic element i am not sure there was nothing funny about nausicaa and i think it was better off for it still having said that dola the pirate leader is easily the most memorable character in the film even if she is basically a female long john silver do not be surprised if you are reminded of treasure planet at times and is well voiced by cloris leachman in the american dub the english voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part actually however something started going pear shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark i think the best way that i could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story i will come back to that later there is so much to admire about laputa and so many people obviously love it that i almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10 but for me the operative word here is admire it was more impressive than personally affecting and at over two hours it just started to drag the crucial thing for me was this i really found that i did not care much about any of the characters disney would have taken the care to develop the characters make you really fall for them rather than leave them as relatively two dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard sf in the story to make up for it but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about princesses and magic crystals that is where laputa falls down as far as i am concerned and that is what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie having said that it must be admitted that miyazaki was leagues ahead of disney in general in 1986 when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire great mouse detective laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film and you should definitely see it but i do feel it is over rated i definitely prefer the earlier nausicaa of the valley of the wind btw if you manage to watch them in chronological order watch for the fox squirrel from nausicaa popping up briefly in laputa
cute film about three lively sisters from switzerland often seen running about in matching outfits who want to get their parents back together seems mom is still carrying the torch for dad so they sail off to new york to stop the dad from marrying a blonde gold digger he calls precious dad has not seen his daughters in ten years they oddly enough do not seem to mind and think he is wonderful and meanwhile precious seems to lead a life mainly run by her overbearing mother alice brady a woman who just wants to see to it her daughter marries a rich man the sisters get the idea of pushing precious into the path of a drunken hungarian count tricking the two gold digging women into thinking he is one of the richest men in europe but a case of mistaken identity makes the girls think the count is good looking ray milland who goes along with the scheme because he has a crush on sister kay this film is enjoyable light fare barbara read as kay comes across as sweet and pretty ray milland looks oh so young and handsome here though unfortunately is given little to do alice brady is quite good as the scheming mother but it is deanna durbin a real charmer and cute as a button playing youngest sister penny who pretty much steals the show with absolutely beautiful vocals she sings several songs throughout the film though i actually would have liked to have seen them feature her even more in this the plot in this film is a bit silly but nevertheless i found the film to be entertaining and fun
pleasant story of the community of pimlico in london who after an unexploded ww2 bomb explodes find a royal charter stating that the area they live in forms part of burgundy this movie works because it appeals to the fantasy a lot of us have about making up our own rules and not having to listen to them a solid cast of british stalwarts especially stanley holloway makes this more believable there are some very nice moments in the film such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other londoners on the other side of the barricade start throwing food and other things over to them even though you always knew pimlico would become part of the uk again the people of pimlico and as a consequence the viewer does not mind when this happens leaving a nice happy feeling it is amazing to think that these low budget movies from a small studio in london still remain so popular over fifty years later the producers must have got something right
i adored this movie not only because i am a big fan of moritz bleibtreu although he is in practically all german movies that count but also because he is not the main actor the lead is taken over by barnaby metschurat who was the only reason to watch 2001s julietta and who really carries this movie on his shoulders a family moves from italy to germany seeking the german dream this is my own invention and ironic  of cheap labor in steel and coal industries however they end up opening a restaurant and the journey the movie takes to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming from this point onward the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family giancarlo bleibtreu and gigi metschurat gigis dream to become a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mothers determination to return to italy what follows is a great and totally neutral look at what life can become formed by the choices you make in the end this movie does not say which life gigis or giancarlos was more successful or fuller or more interesting it merely gives us a rewarding glimpse at what it must be like to search for identity when two countries and mentalities are involved and this look is not driven by bitterness or disdain to either country which makes it such a great film for any and every country dealing with the tensions resulting from immigration the fact that director fatih akins moved to germany from turkey in the 70s also lends this movie a large measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy the icing on the cake are fantastic performances by the entire cast especially metschurat and this i really need to stress the little boy who plays young gigi that kids performance would be a hard act to follow by just about anyone great movie go see it
what a master piece to take the cold war conflict and transport it to the future this film is satire of the highest order in my humble opinion it outranks dr strangelove the clever naming of the two superpowers as the confederation and the market cons being commies and market the west outstanding the clever use of gen joxs was ahead of its time only are we really seeing the dangers of genetic engineering robot joxs tackled the issue head on in 1989 the message of this film is about the comradeship of the humble man and how it can overcome the wishes of government this movies screams do not do it you fools you will kill us all excellent 1010

after aakrosh  this was the second film for govind nihalani as a director till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in india this movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence it was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released this movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood likecoolie betaabhero in 1983 smithapatel in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him she was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs at one timeshe even gave up her love when the heros ruthlessness touched the roof top there was another character in this movie which was played by om puri contemporary naseeruddin shah he played as an inspector turned alcoholic character the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the heros ending in his debut filmsadashiv amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare the cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent the anger which left half handedly continued in govind nihalanis other film drohkaal even after two decades this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew each one played their part par excellence
considering the lack of art with in african cinema or black american cinema the idea offers a multidimensional look at a community assigned to hoods and dealers but the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short but it is the unstated assertion of independence from these themes that is most sticking the genre is unique and not the typical expectation it is almost this departure which first catches the eye so watching it twice is critical the film has an aesthetic quality which lends its self to the true art of cinema and it is this true art that with an african voice that is extremely rare the film does not copy to attain its message it innovates and provokes by pulling at subtle stereotypes not racial but character based stereotypes from a writers perspective the film is brilliant it carries multiply messages which include a very rapid character development it must be remember this film is less than 10 minutes and it manages to establish character very quickly the usage of colour texture and music is also to be commended but considering the director owen alik shahadahs last venture 500 years later music is to be expected but from a theme point of view it seems like the idea is a departure but the satire eludes indirectly to a social problembrilliant stuff
the dehumanising effect of war is a much studied subject in the movies as is the equally dehumanising but potentially life saving dehumanising effect of military training joel schumachers tigerland follows the standard template we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained typically as here vietnam but tigerland has an interesting take by centring its account on a cocky dissident named bozz played outstandingly well by colin farrell who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity around this character a taught gripping plot has been constructed and it is also a plus that the action never leaves america whereas stanley kubricks full metal jacket to name just one other film of a similar type lost focus once the action shifted to asia although this is not a film of staggering originality it is supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout the best film from this director that i have seen and among the very best of its genre

this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival but unlike yes by sally potter which i had seen some days before where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive this time quite the opposite thing happened there was something that dragged me down and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe it was as if all of a sudden there was nothing left all hope all future had been taken away to a dead place ninas life seemed to be dismal and locked but then one lovely day there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion just out of nothing someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life that person was toni a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots just like herself but the films title is ghosts and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish there is no way to retain them

margaritas and cock this tremendously entertaining film grabs you from the opening scene and never stops delivering laughs surprises and unexpectedly touching moments i had more fun watching the matador than almost any other film from 2005 it is a wacky film with an unforgettable character played to perfection by pierce brosnan julian noble brosnan is a facilitator hit man who specializes in high end corporate gigs assassinating rich dudes he is also experiencing something akin to a mid life crisis after coming to realization that he has no real friends no permanent home and no planned future he stumbles into a mexican hotel bar one night and runs into danny wright kinnear danny is a down on his luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him he loves his wife dearly especially so since they lost their young son a few years earlier the two men are chalk and cheese hardly any common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one night and somehow a conversation is struck that sets in to motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever the friendship they form reminded me a lot of laurel and hardy one is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble the interplay is superbly timed and finely tuned due in no small part to the wonderful performances from brosnan and kinnear but make no mistake this is brosnans film he imprints one of the most memorable and despicably likable characters of the decade he could shoot your mother and apologize immediately thereafter and you would probably forgive him brosnan may be cinemas ultimate charmer but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date i would not be averse to seeing an oscar nod for this role consider one scene where he overtly ogles a high school girl with the impurest of thoughts and utters the line all blushy blushy no sucky fucky he does it with the familiar bond smirk and manages to get away with it he manages to tell a young boy tell your mother to lose 30lbs and 20 years then get back to me without coming across as unlikable in fact it makes us like him even more and yet the film manages to surprise us with some truly touching scenes most of which come toward the end when the film takes some unpredictable turns however when julian thumbs through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday or when danny and his wife davis console each other in their bedroom one night the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion the matador is stylish and energetic it is constantly entertaining and it contains a career defining role for brosnan as the lonely hit man looking for normalcy friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life this is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this film as soon as possible tc candler of independentcritics com
the third fred macmurraycarole lombard film is a bit more serious than hands across the table and the princess comes across it is yet another adaption of the play burlesque which apparently was popular back in the day the original play burlesque ran on broadway in the 1927 1928 season for 372 performances and it is the role that carole lombard plays that barbara stanwyck originated on broadway that brought her to hollywood a version starred nancy carroll in the early days of talkies and later on betty grable and dan dailey did still another version of it in when my baby smiles at me in fact i have a vinyl album of a radio version that al jolson and ruby keeler did for the lux radio theater that is an interesting work believe me anyway macmurray and lombard do fine by the old chestnut the story is now set in a nightclub where lombard is a singer and macmurray is a jazz trumpeter note a nice performance by dorothy lamour as the latin vixen who gets between fred and carole also anthony quinn is in one of his earliest films as a wolf on the make for lombard swing high swing low holds up real nice today and i would not be surprised if we see yet another version of burlesque for the twenty first century
the wonderfully urbane ronald coleman is show cased here as in few other of his films he is literally in every scene and this comical movie remains fresh because of him not in spite of him he is handsome witty and very clever here as he remains a step ahead of his wandering lovely wife played perfectly by anna lee the movie is based on a french play and brings all the best qualities of that farce most of the supporting cast is well known at least by face if not name and are absolutely perfect for this very funny film the fantastic mr coleman is a combination of sean connery and clark gable as he stays a step ahead of the other characters his multi talents can be further appreciated in the classic lost horizon which every film buff must see
both visually and musically stunning a treat for both the eye and the ear the quintessential victorian element of the opening sequences were completely enchanting helping to create a christmas scene of which dickens himself would have been justifiably proud technically the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are both imaginatively devised and creatively achieved in a traditional stage setting the dancing of many of the lead artistes is breathtakingly good the photography and lighting are first class and the sound recording admirably matches the overall high level of technical skills employed a great film for all the family at christmas time and a most delightful discovery which will withstand multiple viewing
happenstance is the most new york feeling parisian film i have seen since when the cats away chacun cherche son chat a film from last year released now to capitalize on the attention audrey tatou is getting for amelie its french title is more apt le battement dailes du papillon the beating of the butterflys wings as in summarizing chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives tatous gamine ness is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures and because she is part of a large multi ethnic ensemble so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me and some of the characters fantasize what they should do such that i was not sure if they were doing that or not but i loved how urban the coincidences were from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around cafés the subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once originally written 1282001
those who love elivra as i did in her late night movie hostess duties will love this movie she is just plain cool her car is great and she is a bit of a transylvanian dolly parton she is so innocent and naive at times and sexy all of the time plus more than a touch of mae west the sets are well done as well and the comic cast is great with edie mcclurg at her usual best plus sally kellerman as patty is hilarious any time i have to crunch something for a topping i will think of how elvira crunches the potato chips this movie is one to be watched again and again just for the fun of it now i have to get the sequel to it elviras haunted hills and see if it lives up to this one
this showtime movie really deserves a far better viewer rating than a 4 5 i gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars after reading the viewer comments i was surprised at how many folks expected this movie to be a comedy yeah i see that imdb lists it as comedydrama under genre that sure is misleading is not it fortunately i saw the movie before logging onto this website so i did not have that expectation in fact based on the synopsis of what i heard i fully expected it to simply be a drama i am wondering if disappoint at this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes another factor that might have caused low votes is that this movie is very much character driven driving miss daisy is an example of another character driven movie that comes to mind someone is previous comment complained about a boring trial toms danny glover work scenes seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie that is how he was engineering the upward social climb of his family or his personal troops if you will however they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to greenwich and move up in the world toms obsession became a compulsion he proved that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white neighborhood his chagrin when another black person moved next door was not due to skin color it was because of everything the interloper represented everything that tom had left behind in essence tom had become an oreo cookie black on the outside but white on the inside the last 20 minutes of this movie are among the most powerfully written directed and acted by whoopi goldberg i have ever had the pleasure to witness i realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened next door do not want to give it away the climax is verbal and whoopi delivers it i am still not clear if it is the conversation when she informs tom which college tom two is going to or when she releases it all in the middle of the night and tom wakes up nevertheless the denouement is great you know that life on that street will never be the same my favorite kind of character driven flick people go through problems some pain do their dance they grow they change and life goes on as an audience member i may learn something or be inspired
girlfight is much more of a coming of age story than it is a fight flick and what a relief to have one in an urban school with naturalistic realistic latinos and believable use of brooklyn project settings it made me realize that virtually all hollywood high school movies are set in luxurious suburbia or small towns even the somewhat comparable love and basketball which focused on teen african americans was set in suburbia  while these kids share some of the same peer problems those issues shrink compared to the other struggles of these kids where high school graduation could be the major accomplishment of their lives the feminist element here is riveting in its originality as you hold your breath to see if she can have a relationship and a victory on her terms a lots of audience sympathy goes to the guy who is challenged to rise to a gender bending expectations situation the movie does drag a bit here and there but this is no cheap thrills rocky fight movie as the practices and fights have complex outcomes and all the relationships especially with fathers and father figures take more center stage than the center ring there were lots of interesting music credits listed at the end but i had not really noticed the songs originally written 1072000
