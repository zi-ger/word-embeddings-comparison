working with one of the best shakespeare sources this film manages to be creditable to it is source whilst still appealing to a wider audience branagh steals the film from under fishburnes nose and there is a talented cast on good form
well tremors i the original started off in 1990 and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch however they proceeded to make tremors ii and iii trust me those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one i mean ass blasters now only god himself is capable of answering the question why in gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie tremors iv cannot be considered a bad movie in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie for it lives up to more than that as i attempted to sit though it i noticed that my eyes started to bleed and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the tv and kill me did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we are from the wild west would make the movie with the exact same occurrences any better honestly i would never suggest buying this movie i mean there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well
ouch this one was a bit painful to sit through it has a cute and amusing premise but it all goes to hell from there matthew modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying and he does not disappoint in this one deborah kara unger and john neville turned in surprisingly decent performances alan bates and jennifer tilly among others played it way over the top i know that is the way the parts were written and it is hard to blame actors when the script and director have them do such schlock if you are going to have outrageous characters that is ok but you got to have good material to make it work it did not here run away screaming from this movie if at all possible
i have seen some crappy movies in my life but this one must be among the very worst definately bottom 100 material i am going to that is we follow two couples the dodds billy bob thornton as lonnie earl and natasha richardson as darlene and the kirkendalls patrick swayze as roy and charlize theron as candy in one car on a roadtrip to reno apparently lonnie is not too happy with his sex life so he cheats on his wife with candy who is despirately trying to have a baby roy meanwhile is not too sure if his sperm is ok so he is getting it checked by a doctor now i had read the back of the dvd but my girlfriend did not and she blurted out after about 20 minutes oh yeah she is going to end up pregnant but her husband can not have any babys spot on as this movie is soooo predictable as well as boring and annoying meaningless offensive terrible an example of how much this movie stinks the two couples set out in their big car towards nevada when they are stopped by 2 police officers as they did not stop at a stop sign the guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a case of beer not only is this scene pointless and not important or even relevant for the movie it takes about 5 minutes it is just talk and talk and talk without ever going somewhere i still have to puke thinking about the ending though apparently roy is not having problems down there so he is the father of the child how many times does that happen in the movies try something new the cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after yuck best scene of the movie is right at the end with a couple of shots of the grand canyon why could not they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutesone would expect more from this cast although thornton really tries but you can not really blame them writers shame on you110
carriers follows the exploits of two guys and two gals in a stolen mercedes with the words road warrior on the hood hightailing it down the highway for the beach with surfboards strapped to the top of their car brian chris pine of star trek is driving and his girlfriend bobby piper perabo of coyote uglyhas shotgun while brians younger brother danny lou taylor pucci of fanboys and his friend not exactly girlfriend kate emily vancamp of the ring 2 occupy the backseat this quartet of twentysomething characters are living in a nightmare apparently a viral pandemic which co directors  co scenarists alex pastor and david pastor tell us absolutely nothing about has devastated america naturally the lack of exposition shaves off at least fifteen minutes that would have slowed down this cynical melodrama about how humans degenerate in a crisis and become their own worst enemies this lethal virus gives you the shingles and then you bleed and die most everybody runs around wearing those white masks strapped to their nose and mouth by a thin rubber band initially this foursome encounters a desperate father frank christopher meloni of runaway brideand his cute little daughter jodie kiernan shipka of land of the lost blocking the highway with their suv brian swerves around frank when he tries to waylay them but in the process the oil pan in their mercedes ruptures and they wind up on foot reluctantly they hitch a ride with frank after they seal jodie up in the rear of the suv she wears a mask over her nose and mouth and it is speckled with blood frank has heard that doctors are curing ailing people at a hospital and they head to it sadly somebody has lied to frank the hospital physician is giving the last couple of kids some kool aid that will put them out of their misery the cure did not improve their condition everybody else in town is dead kate tries without success to get a dial tone on every phone frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter and he let us the heroic quartet appropriate his suv and take off indeed carriers qualifies as a relentlessly depressing movie about the effects of a pandemic on four sympathetic people who degenerate into homicidal murderers to protect themselves they reach a country club and frolic around on a golf course until another four show up in suits and masks with pump action shotguns incredibly our protagonists manage to escape without getting shot but brian has a scare when he almost falls into the water with a floating corpse eventually they discover that one of them has become infected later as they are about to run out of gas brian blocks the highway like frank did at the outset danny tries to stop a pair of older christian women driving the car danny lies that his pregnant wife is about to give birth and he needs their help brian throws caution to the wind and blasts away at the ladies with his automatic pistol when they refuse to help them brian catches a slug in the leg from the passenger but he kills her nocarriers is not a beer  pizza movie that you can either laugh off or laugh with because the humor is virtually non existent by the end of this 84 minute movie our heroes have turned into villains who only care only for themselves and their plight chris pine makes quite an impression as fun loving brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum while the only other well known actress piper perabo is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role as bobby she makes tragic the mistake of showing compassion to a dying little girl and pays an awful price it is a testament to pines performance that he can change his character to the point of putting himself before others essentially pine has the only role that gives him the ability to pull a one eighty from happy go lucky guy to heartless guy the two directors are spanish brothers and they never let the momentum flag since there is no relief in sight carriers sinks into predictability irréversible cinematographer benoît debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes debie makes it look like a dynamic film aside from the lack of a happy ending or closure in any sense of the word carriers suffers because it is so horribly cynical the scene when the german shepherd attacks danny conjures up the most suspense but even it could have been improved unfortunately the pastor brothers do not scare up either much tension or suspense by fade out you really do not care what happens to anybody
i had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time after seeing return to paradise which i found to be gritty i was so disappointed the most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable ending which i think was partly stolen from return to paradise  maybe i was expecting too much on the positive side danes beckinsale and pullman were fantastic in their roles although i did not like daness character and first and found her very annoying i could not see anything realistic about the film it could of been done so much better for example there could of been more emphasis on the prison conditions and the sheer horror it was too cheery a movie to be realistic there could also of been more action and tensionthe best thing about this film is the tragic ending i could not of predicted that but by that time i really did not care what happened to them 310
effects without because is generally not possible in the real world but in the world of hollywood remakes not only is it possible it is required the haunting has been given the computer treatment courtesy of a 1st class cinematographer turner director who once showed promise jan de bont speed but has since produced a string of big budget garbage twister speed 2 actor are superfluous in a movie of this type and they seem to realize it liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones act like they wish they were anywhere but in this film lili taylor makes an attempt to add something to the proceedings but whatever that something might be is unknown since the script feels like half of it is missing events just happen good and bad ghosts show up with no rhyme or reason and then the story just ends with a most unsatisfying non event meant to wrap up the previous 90 minutes of inanity there really is not even reason to see this for the effects since we all know that anything can be put on screen now why not watch effects in the service of a good story instead of just for their own sake
this picture started out with good intentions bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility and shue is cute as usual in her role it all falls apart after that it is your typical hollywood thriller now filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore minus any kind of humour wit or soul in other words do not waste your time watching this get the audiocassette tape with john delancie as the invisible man instead also starring leonard nimoy now that was good and hg wells is well served unlike with this mess
i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone is been fixing the score either way it was a real disappointment the movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest there really is no reason to give a summary of the plot but here goes it felt like someone had been thinking would not it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff and that is about it the plot is thin and unoriginal the snakes are bad cgi but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone the acting is poor and all people are unbelievable stereo types to sum it up it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen stay away
this film has to be the worst i have ever seen the title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope the story line of the film is laughable at best with the acting so poor you just have to cringe the title zombie nation implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total this cannot be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy 80s music when the zombies attack the zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a la roux video if you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so then burn the copy
i felt brain dead i will tell you this is the worst film i have ever bought in my ignorance i thought this was the peter jackson film of the same name the performances are so terrible they are laughable the special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire the script promotes that kind of tv movie stare into the middle distance kind of acting the cast look as if they have been taking lessons from joey tribbiani they have one look each and stick to it plus i have never been confused by a movie until i sat down to watch this the is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes avoid like a plague
a young scientist is trying to carry on his dead fathers work on limb regeneration his overbearing mother has convinced him that he murdered his own father and is monitoring his progress for her own evil purposes a young doctor uses reptilian dna he extracts from a large creature and when his arm is conveniently ripped off a few minutes laterhe injects himself with his formula and grows a new murderous arm admittedly the special effects in severed ties are pretty good and grotesquebut the rest of the film is awful the severed arm is behaving like a snake and kills few people big deal the acting is mediocre and the climax is silly 3 out of 10
inept boring and incoherent supernatural thriller in which college student cassie melissa sagemiller is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims the life of her boyfriend sean casey affleck i can not begin to tell you how bad this is nothing of any importance ever happens nor is there ever any sort of actual entertainment value i did not like this cast in this particular film they are all sadly unconvincing then again their roles are no good to promote this as a horror film is a joke where are the scares there is no sense or suspense there are a few good songs but that is about it how on earth did this project get the green light writer director steve carpenter has no discernible vision or talent that i can sense worst of all the conclusion really makes the whole movie pointless the alleged killer cut that i watched is 86 minutes of pure tedium 110
from the first time i saw the box cover of the movie and the stretched out photography i thought this guy this friend of the scwarz must be like 6 foot or 6ft 2in not 5 feet tall not that it is his fault at any rating i turned on the movie one cool night in tucson out on the second story deck with a good cigar and let it roll at that time my wife was having an affair and things were going down hill for me so i needed a good diversion but as bad as the movie was i totally enjoyed it with a bottle of merlot too i might admit truly i have watched this movie many times it always makes me feel good it is not that it tries too hard to be cool or that it is so close to hitting the mark for an action film it is frantic and then truly clueless then frantic again it is the best of the best when it comes to a slow speed chase scene wow i never felt safer in my life warm and happy too i was thankful that they conserved on the gasoline during the chase due to less production in the summer months anywho the direction was uninspired the action and fight sequences needed to be choreographed or re choreographed and tightened up the sound was off the delivery did not hit you it just kept on going the other way the locals of that village that they were in the town rather were off cue they also did not seem to follow what was happening very well the would look and even stare into the camera lens like a deer in the head lights kind of thing only some of them with a smile a smiling deer i feel bad because columbu i just bet has a good heart and a caring spirit for people in america as well as for his own countrymen however barettas island is very lethargic and unbelievable even still i like it a lot my now x wife hates it but i love it the funny thing is i am pretty discriminating when it comes to movies i like or even love all in all i like franco so there it is as a movie adding addendum to this if you like killing a few hours with truly fun to watch straight to video b movies or bad movies for your little library collection then if you can find it check out the big sweat 1991 with robert z dar you know the big guy from tango  cash the big sweat a bomb of a cop story with no real plot discovery and acting that is so lame it might as well be on crutches and at the end of the big sweat i think they ran out of money because they had a picture of the cast and just set it on fire and let it burn during the credits good fun but all in all not as good as barettas island i gave it a 1 and an overall rating of awful for awful good b movie i am waiting for the sequel maybe like barettas revenge on montazuma franco takes a mexican vacation and gets sick on the water then declares war on the water co  or barettas powder war where as he would stake out a large drug lord in his country and chemically gene splice and create a hybrid super bug insect that would be bred and dropped into the cocaine fields and eat the coke and upon passing it through the bug it forms a chemical reaction that turns the coke to pure powdered sugar then another sequel he would have to get the young people rescued from excessive sugar addiction and so on he could get a major tooth paste company to endorse and partially fund the project with careful product placement in the feature right
i find it hard to believe that anyone would put this movie in the same context as the exorcist where the exorcist was subtle and creepy stigmata was blunt clumsy and way too formulaic this is one of the most visually beautiful films i have seen in a while but the imagery does not make up for the downward spiral of patronizing exposition that makes it unbearable my interest in this movie was peaked when it was compared to the exorcist and my visit to the official web site increased that interest the web site had many tales of actual stigmata throughout history however scene by scene the movie is so obsessed by its quest for genuineness that it becomes comical at first then outright hard to watch toward the end i began getting suspicious when the priest charged with investigating potential miracles walks into the beauty parlor where our would be heroine cuts hair and evidently flirts with priests the plot a woman without faith in god begins receiving the wounds of christ the stigmata and is baffled and upset about the ordeal a priest is sent straight from the vatican to investigate the case is frankie possessed by satan or a vessel for jesus christthe only miracle in this film is that it finally ends
i actually saw china ofbrien ii before i ever saw the original china ofbrien and i have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse but worse  funnier and funnier  better if you are a bad movie fan like i am this is great material if however you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot acting ability or movie making skill this is best avoided the best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fast forward hilariously bad see it for a laugh see it for mindless entertainment but whatever you do see it for free on tv
i went to school with jeremy earl that is how i heard of this movie i do not really know if it was in the theaters at all i do not recall the name i have seen it it is like one of those after school specials the acting is ok not great the plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny so the only comment i can give this movie is eh i borrowed the movie from jeremy if i was in a movie rental place this is one that i would walk past and after watching it i would not recommend it to anyone past middle school age i have also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed the slang is overused or just outdated many times i think that is what makes their characters unbelievable
i have not seen this do not plan to see this movie or any other that includes lindsay unless  until poor little rich girl straightens out her life for a 2 year period beginning with her most recent arrest in july 2007 in fact i do not know anyone that has gone to see any of lindsays recent movies i rather imagine 2007 will be the high water mark in her movie making career until she cleans up her act all of the recent publicity has only hindered her movie making career if she has any further aspirations to make any more movies up to this time movie producers have actively sought lindsay for roles in their upcoming production now lindsay will probably have to go to auditions  actually compete for any role her reputation is currently poison  quite possible could have a negative effect on box office ticket sales on any movie she is in sooooo now lindsay is going to have to deal with not being wanted is she going to be able to handle thisi wonder if even jay leno will want to have lindsay back on his tv showall of the foregoing is merely my opinion i have no inside information
i have not seen anything this bad since i walked out of the james bond movie moonraker twenty years ago i managed to sit through the entirety of this one only because of tilda swinton but there was nothing she could do to save this beast as a cross between pi orlando and tron this movie failed miserably in every aspect of moviemaking the characters were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy the plot was wholly unbelievable the acting was with the exception of swinton amateur the computer graphics were worse than in tron  timothy leary was extremely annoying i could go on but what is the point the only good thing i can say about this film is that tilda swinton was in it i have no idea why an actress of her caliber consented to appear in such a dud but she most likely regrets it now do not waste your money or your time on this stinker there is nothing worth seeing here
one would think that a film about a young persons coming to terms with his burgeoning homosexuality would be anything but boring think again this production should be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia because it is about ten times as potent as any sleep aid on the market it is almost as if the film maker considered making a movie but got lazy and decided instead to run a series of random and randomly boring images and go nowhere scenes throw in a couple of actual scenes featuring actual acting pretend that good lighting inst important in the film making process and wrap it up under the auspices of an arthouse film this is exactly kind of crappy product that makes it easy for a lot of traditional film makers to poo poo the indie film movement and which keeps the general public from more easily embracing indie films if you are interested in films covering this subject matter you would be much better off tuning in to some of the great short films available at logos website or renting get real better yet read stone butch blues whatever you do skip this long winded piece of dreck
we have all seen this story a hundred times you can see each plot turn coming a mile away the relationship between the mother and daughter is way too sweet and understanding to pass for realistic janet mcteers performance is stock southern hot ticket mother in vintage clothes should have been made for the lifetime channel
i should love this movie the acting is very good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me the movie makes working class people look low and cheap the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy barbara stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it again the acting was very very good and worth watching i really do not like the story line just a personal preference thank you
the king maker will doubtless be a success in thailand where the similar but superior the legend of suriyothai set box office records the film directed by lek kitaparaporn after a screenplay by sean casey based on historical fact in 1547 siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest pedestrian scripts and story development on film the event the picture relates is the arrival of the portuguese soldier of fortune fernando de gamma gary stretch whose vengeance for this fathers murderer drives him to shipwrecked captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in ayutthaya in the kingdom of siam where he is purchased by the beautiful maria cindy burbridge with the consent of her father phillipe john rhys davies a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses there is a plot to overthrown the king and fernando and his new siamese sidekick tong dom hetrakul after some gratuitous cgi enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness are first rewarded by the king to become his bodyguards only to be imprisoned together once queen sudachan yoe hassadeevichit reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover lord chakkraphat oliver pupart to take over the rule of siam yet of course fernando and tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families tongs wife and children and fernandos now firm love affair with maria with the expected consequences the acting with the exception of john rhys davies is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp the predominantly thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog making us wish they had used their native thai with subtitles the musical score by ian livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old tv soap operas but if it is visual splendor you are after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching it is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions it is just the basics that are missing grady harp
disney goes to the well one too many times as anybody who has seen the original little mermaid will feel blatantly ripped off celebrating the birth of their daughter melody ariel and eric plan on introducing her to king triton the celebration is quickly crashed by ursula s sister morgana who plans to use melody as a defense tool to get the king s trident stopping the attack ariel and eric build a wall around the ocean while melody grows up wondering why she cannot go in there awful and terrible is what describes this direct to video sequel little mermaid 2 gives you that feeling everything you watch seemed to have come straight other disney movies i guess disney can only plagiarize itself do not tell me that the penguin and walrus does not remind you of another duo from the lion kingother disappointing moments include the rematch between sebastien and louie the royal chef they terribly under played it the climax between morgana and everyone seemed to be another disappointment i will not give anything away but in 75 minutes everything seemed incredibly cramped and too much to handle an embarrassment to disney little mermaid 2 is better left to rent and laugh at then you can prepare for the rest of the other sequels disney is going to drown you in later on
quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes the only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners do not get me wrong i love silly stupid movies just as much as the next gal but the whole premise writing and humor stunk it seemed to me that they were going for a napoleon dynamite feel strange and random scenes which would lead to a cult audience instead it ended up being forced awkward and weird the only bright light was isla fisher and i just felt utterly awful that she and sissy spacek had signed up for this horrible thing thank gosh i did not pay for it
spoilersi was very curious to see this film after having heard that it was clever and witty i had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom i felt the idea behind the film would have been acceptable depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience what made me dislike the whole film were two things first of all the film was so down to earth that it looked as if by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day to day basis it became itself ordinary and dull secondly the overall sloppiness of the production with dialogues that were barely understandable too bad
while some performances were good victoria rowell adrienne barbeau and the two italian girlfriends come to mind the story was lame and derivative the emphasis on the girlfriends racial background was handled clumsily at best and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes not as real people i found myself wincing uncomfortably at many moments that were supposed to be funny i can hardly comprehend why the local paper here in sf said this was a good movie and wonder who posted the glowing review here on imdb very disappointed in this movie and mad i actually went to a theatre to see it based on the faulty connection to garden state which is a far funnier more inventive and touching movie than this one i must especially mention the emotional climax in the church which was so wooden and by the numbers that i nearly left and some in the audience actually did that was followed by a silly climax at the graveyard which i saw coming 10 minutes before it happened i really do not like being misled to spend my money so uselessly
despite what a lot of other people thought about the first movie i really liked it this one however how to sum it up in one word this movie is and here comes the word crapbut let us look at it part by part here is the plot finally the old queen has been removed from her castle but her successor snow white has problems of another sort the court jester father of her son has gone astray as the super spliss goes to the extreme to battle his gray hair and sells the royal offspring for some blond and full hair in her desperation snow white seeks the help of bubi otto walkeeswho must first find his other six dwarf companions and then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name of rumpelstiltskin the whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend where the writers were very drunk but were just under pressure from the studio to write the screenplay yes there are some good jokes even for fans of the first part or for fans of any of the other actors it is really not worth buying the the dvd believe me the only thing that at least kind of saves the movie from complete oblivion are the performances of some of the actors that is why i gave the move 310 sadly the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them combined can make up for the bad story for example at one point they even cross over in our reality and sadly they do not do anything funny while being here still a lot of great actors in this movie otto waalkes ralf schmitz martin schneider nina hagen cosma shiva hagen especially funny rüdiger hoffmann as the mirror helge schneider and many more but sadly all these comedians are not able to bring this really bad script to life maybe it is a treat for some hardcore fans but for regular movie goers or by now dvd renters or buyers it is not worth the money i even regret renting the movie
falsely accused skirt chasing chums john wayne as john scott and eddy chandler as kansas charlie change identities to become alias smith and jones mr wayne becomes john jones mr chandlers is supposed to be rev smith but wayne calls him dr smith at no time are either of them as entertaining as roger davis pete duel jonathan harris or ben murphy although wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them career wise pretty blonde mary kornman as anne grown up from her days in our gang is a lovely interest for wayne she and chandler have a couple of cute scenes with wayne if you are not a fan of low budget john wayne films of the 1930s this movie will not make you one
i am not a big fan of horror films and have only seen a handful of them and none of the halloweens or friday the thirteenths but i can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore and i am pretty sure this is not scary what is so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere in all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots so there is no real surprise in any of this film not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway but  the plot concerns claus von bulows third cousin john hudson who marries a donna reed look a like peggey webber giving one of the worst performances ever who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husbands mansion did i mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident ooooh wonder who did it this is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill andor drive their wife insane if you want to see a well done version of this stuff try reversal of fortune and btw jeremy irons is one hundred times more talented than john hudson the msting was okay but nothing special paired with the gumby short however it makes for good viewing two stars for the screaming skull eight stars for the mst3k version and now to paraphrase mr von bulow himself how bad is this film you have no idea
it is a pity that you cannot vote zero stars on imdb because i would not have hesitated in fact i would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars i like many others bought this film thinking that because it has michael madsen in it it could be good no chance this film was shocking imagine a movie length the bold and the beautiful well primal instinct did not even come close to that good and i had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length the bold and the beautiful michael madsen how could you do this to us the worst part is i did not fast forward a bit i was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad film where do i start  directing zero stars screenplay zero stars acting zero stars cinematography zero stars digital effects zero stars production design zero stars make up zero stars casting zero stars editing zero stars trailer half a star graphic design half a star dvd menu half a star however i think that it is very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad film is so for that reason i am happy that i saw this film just so that i have a bad film to put at the bottom of my list
this was no trainspotting or guy ritchie film it was a big wannabee it wanted to be an edgy nervous laughter urban life affirming film but it is more of a camera jerky mess it is a lot easier to imitate something else than to create a real story with real characters from the beginning i could not care less about the characters or what they were involved in they were always always hitting pissing or crying on each other only there was not any substance to what they were doing the dialog between characters is meant to be hip revealing instead it comes out trite and one scene after another is predictable i know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie so i could be wrong
the movie confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument against the death penalty on any level by presenting the lawful execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie elevates a parent killer to the status of martyr for christ somehow according to the plot god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it is self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds yet this same god has no indignation for the acts of the killer the lead character an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted killer in other threads of the underdeveloped plot jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of god the modern lackluster incarnation of christ not just dehumanizes him but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions as well he is unable to affect humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it is self meanwhile with little help from jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty i also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels this movie which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious point that i could clearly interpret except to mock peoples beliefs it raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer it disregards the religious values of its audience while attempting to portray an asinine version of their fulfillment silly
skullduggery is a strange strange film based on the novel ye shall know them by vercors to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well meaning tone skullduggery simply is not a very good film for me the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can not make its mind up how best to convey its message the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk later it teeters into sci fi fable by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great too jarring to overlook they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you are watching a muddled disorganised movie an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple burt reynolds one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame susan clark after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape like creatures these primitive long lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man  the missing link in the evolution of apes into humans or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics the archaeologists call the tribe the tropi and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen paul hubschmid declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers he questions whether the tropi are truly human and takes his argument to the courts where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued this was a very early film in reynolds career and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he is in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously not that reynolds can be blamed  he has an impossible role asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick his character and the film are not relevant to each other clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox alexander knox and wilfrid hyde white a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids the stuck on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical
i can not say that wargames the dead code is the worst movie i have ever seen as it had one or two decent moments but i can easily say it is the most transparent movie i have ever seen not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it 10 minutes in advance there was no subtlety to anything the movie did no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes every spoken or typed lines intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to get into the movie i found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience far more often than i found myself enjoying the movie
by rights there should never have been a first blood part ii the original script for first blood had john rambo committing suicide at the end of the film but this was changed to allow him to live not because the producers wanted to make a sequel but because test audiences found the original ending too depressing nevertheless someone obviously thought that the character was too good to waste because he ended up as the hero of two more films in the eighties plus the recently released fourth instalment the official title of this film was rambo first blood part ii but it is more commonly known simply as rambo it starts with the title character in jail where he is presumably expiating the crimes he committed in first blood although this is never made too explicit he is removed from prison by his former commanding officer colonel trautman for a secret mission rambo is to return to vietnam to investigate reports that american pows are still being held captive by the communist regime he is under strict instructions not to attempt to rescue any prisoners or to engage the enemy his is to be simply a fact finding mission what rambo does not realise is that he is being set up not by trautman who is portrayed as brave honourable and incorruptible but by the organiser of the mission a military bureaucrat named murdock murdock intends that the mission will prove that there are no american prisoners in vietnam partly because that will improve relationships between the american and vietnamese governments partly because it will make his own life easier unfortunately for murdock rambo discovers that not only are americans still being held prisoner they are also being kept in hellish conditions of course he is far too much of a hero to leave them to their fate and tries to rescue them the rest of the film is more or less one long battle between rambo and a few allies including a beautiful vietnamese girl and the evil commie soldiers and their russian allies most of the evil commies of course end up dead although i was surprised to learn from your trivia section that the total death toll was as low as 67 at times it seemed as though rambo was trying to wipe out the entire vietnamese army the tone of this film is very different from the first in first blood rambo was unquestionably a criminal even though his responsibility for his crimes was lessened by severe provocation and by his mental instability in rambo he is a bona fide all american hero a few years earlier the director george pan cosmatos had made the cassandra crossing a biased piece of left wing anti american propaganda cosmatos however was nothing if not versatile and rambo proves that he could also turn his hand to biased right wing pro american propaganda the one thing the two films have in common is that both are laughably bad first blood had its faults but it also had its virtues its stance that the anti war movement was partly to blame for the problems faced by vietnam vets in readjusting to civilian life was a controversial one but at least the film was trying to make a statement about war social attitudes to war and the roots of violence in society rambo by contrast has very few virtues except that the action sequences are well enough done to please those who like that sort of thing it is essentially a sort of jingoistic revenge fantasy for those americans who were still sore about the vietnam war rambo re fights the war single handed and this time the right side wins take that charlie cong by this point no doubt the films admirers and there seem to be plenty more than 2000 voters have already given it ten stars will have concluded that i am a liberal commie loving pinko far from it in fact i have always despised communism as a pernicious ideology what i dislike about the film is not its politics but its lack of subtlety and its suggestion that the solution to all problems including ideological disputes is to go in with all guns blazing and to try and kill as many people as possible it makes no attempt to understand the political complexities of south east asia or why not everyone in the region was pro american for all its anti communism the film is the sort of moronic sledgehammer propaganda that the communists were very good at churning out themselves except that they attributed all the worlds problems to capitalism or imperialism or revisionism or whatever other ism they had taken a dislike to compared to rambo the green berets was a masterly piece of political analysis 310
i can just about understand why some people might wish to stress this films link with the eighties but i really would not say it is an accurate depiction of most peoples lives in that era even on the poorest bradford estates it is however typical of the blunt agitprop rubbish the dear old royal court theatre was churning out at that time plenty of right on artistry for small small audiences but enough well connected backslapping to ensure future commissions for turgid playrights ithe simple fact is that if you want to reflect upon truer common experience you will find millions more nodding in knowing agreement to love and live as depicted in gregorys girl i would be tempted to call this a kitchen sink drama but that would be doing a great disservice to the plumbing industry however as far as having a decent script is concerned this film is indeed all washed up for some reason it has accrued an odd following amongst guardian reading film goers i can only assume they get a visual frisson out of pretending to slum it steer clear my friends it is a poor film with a poor script that likes to think it is breaking boundaries by adding humorous insights into grim life on the estates it is not but it is grim do the washing up instead
minor spoilerswell i just sat up late and watched this film mainly because i enjoyed and rated some of singletons earlier work like boyz n the hood however i have to say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived clichéd so called message movies the acting is mainly poorpop stars and models do not necessarily make good actors take note the situations hard to swallow rape victim becomes overnight lesbian please but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of by the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its one dimensional players not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural sexual and political ignorance as a result it merely ends up sensationalising the results of these problems it is message is contradictory resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion as for the films conclusion i found it predictable embarrassing exploitative and mildly offensive for a film called higher learning i have to say all i learned is to avoid seeing this ever again if you want a true comment on some of the themes that this film completely fails to elaborate upon then go hire american history x unless you were just watching it for tyra banks then go hire a life
the original exploitation classic though far from enjoyable on almost any level concerning some guys who turn cats into human flesh eating monsters because the cat food they make is made with people is remade with scifi elements added the cats can not get enough and when the flesh tainted food runs out the cats turn on their owners poorly put together on almost every level this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that used to actually play movie theaters in the early 1970s updated with alien cat and dog races battling for supremacy director ted mikel is a hack but is so lovable a person i generally like the guy thanks to his smile inducing interviews and commentary tracks that you can pretty much excuse the garbage he mostly turned out mikels wanted to make films and he did not care how they turned out so long as he was producing something more power to him but i wish he would not subject us to his home movies
great cast great acting unpredictable story line for the first halfhour or so i was really wanting to know what was going tohappen to each of these unredeeming characters and how theirseemingly disparate lives would become intertwined but whenthe writers took out the glue to start connecting the players theymistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstillfor the last two hours i kept thinking it would get better but it onlygot worse do not believe the reviews this is a waste of time think about it tom cruise made ugly why the gorgeoushunky bartender wearing braces why i know it had to do withthe plot but without them at least there would have been oneattractive cast member to remember
there are many different versions of this one floating around so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there the cut i saw has the on screen title witchcraft evil encounters and was released by shriek show who maintain the original us release title witchery for the dvd release it is a nice looking print and seems to have all of the footage but has some croppingaspect ratio issues in italy it was released as la casa 4 witchcraft the first two la casa releases were actually the first two evil dead films retitled and the third la casa was another film by the same production company filmirage which is best known here in america as ghosthouse to make matters even more confusing witchery was also released elsewhere as ghosthouse 2 except in germany where ghosthouse 2 is actually the ogre demons 3 ok i better just shut up now i am starting to confuse myselfregardless of the title this is a very hit or miss horror effort some of it is good some of it is not i actually was into this film for the first half or so but toward the end it became a senseless mess a large vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from boston is the setting as various people get picked off one by one by a german speaking witch hildegard knef photographer gary david hasselhoff who wants to capture witch light and his virginal writer girlfriend leslie cumming who is studying witchcraft are shacking up at the hotel without permission along comes real estate agent jerry rick farnsworth who is showing off the property to potential buyers rose annie ross and freddie robert champagne brooks also tagging along are their children pregnant grown daughter jane linda blair and very young son tommy michael manchester as well as oversexed architect linda sullivan catherine hickland hasselhoffs wife at the time once everyone is inside their boat driver is killed hung and the boat disappears so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the lady in black so what can you expect to find here plenty of unpleasantries one of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow roasted by the rest of the cast there is also a crucifixion witches eating a dead baby a swordfish through the head someone set on fire a possession a sesame street tape recorder the virgin getting raped by some demon a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff from a technical standpoint it is a nice looking film with pretty good cinematography a decent score and good gore effects the hotelisland setting is also pretty nice blair particularly at the end and ross both seem like they are having fun and knef is great as the evil witch even though people like to ridicule hasselhoff these days he is not bad in his role either on the down side despite all the gore the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour the supernatural themes are muddled and confusing too when characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy and the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber and while most of the cast is at least decent a few of the performances particularly the actress who plays hasselhoffs girlfriend and the kid are so bad they are constantly distracting
this was just horrible the plot was just ok but the rest of the was was bad i mean come on puppet and then they even tried to make the movie digital and that made it even worse normally i would like low budget movie but this was just a waste of time and almost made me want to return the set that it came on i have about ten low budget movie set with like 6 8 movies on them and i would have to say this is the worse movie out of all of them also the wording is off and they use a fake plastic machetes that does not even look like a real one they could of used one that looked even a little close to a real one so save your time and money and do not watch this horrorible movie
this is the biggest piece of lamo i have ever watched it is excruciatingly boring i would have rather sat through a seminar on creationism than have watched this if i had known it was going to be as boring as it was not even the 40 seconds of the hot chick in the bikini with the big ta tas redeems this of anything lower than a 1 the reviews of this movie claiming that this movie is unintentionally funny are absurd and just plain wrong not one thing is funny about this movie they spend the first 50 or so minutes walking through the woods talking about stuff you would not understand nor care about and it is just as lame when the people start dying because you do not even know who the people are because they are so uninteresting honestly though i did not watch it to the ending but that should say something about how horrible it is worst movie ever immediately after ejecting this filth from my dvd player i started scraping it against the cement in front of my house not wanting other blockbuster customers to have to fall upon the same mistake i had made as to rent this movie then zach peed his pants thankyou for your time
strange i like all this movie crew and dark humor movies but did not like this one at all it is awful horrible and surely not funny at all pity cannot do a whole movie plot disgust either and it was really boring long empty moments fills the movie it could have been removed it should have been in another shorter format surely maybe i expected too much from the crew like saving the movie lol it is also filled with overused clichés of characters and situations i do not get it why people liked it poetry hope nope mam did not see anything like that  all in all it is empty and crude pitiful and hopeless oh darn this one
this is another typical unbelievable and non sensical piece of hollywood dreck kurt russell as snake pliskin in a business suit convinces me he was a better 2nd baseman ray liotta as the psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd madeline stowe is her usual cardboard self and does little to be a convincing victim every scene in this persiflage is absolutely predictable all the way to the end when kurt clouts ray with a vase or something knocking him down and out kurt and madeline then do their obligatory end of the movie embrace and everybody except russell and stowe knows liotta is going to get back up and menace the couple again he does of course and russell drills him 10 times with his 9mm which was entirely unnecessary this movie could just as well ended with the bludgeoning scene except hollywood dotes on unnecessary violence and the more they can add or enhance the more slobbery they get
the tenuous connection between this film and the first grease is established right at the beginning of the film when didi conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young maxwell caulfield who is a british exchange student although in the previous film olivia newton st johns foreign speech pattern is not explained it is explained here caulfield is her cousin what is conn still doing in school i guess she just likes hanging around rydell high even though now she is a beautician caulfields a smart kid so of course the hood types led by adrian zmed have him labeled as a nerd and that is especially bad when zmeds girl friend decides she likes caulfield but being a nerd just is not going to cut it that is when caulfield decides to put on a modern day zorro act he gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride he gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face if getting michelle pheiffer is not in the cards caulfield will not have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he is outfitted grease 2 introduced michelle pheiffer and maxwell caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed if you saw the first grease film a much better film than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out in addition to conn eve arden sid caesar and dody goodman all faculty members from the original grease return in their roles the music score is not remotely as good as the songs that come from the original it is not that grease 2 is bad it is just not all that great
i think i have seen all of the grisham movies now and generally they are all very poor except for the rainmaker but this one is so bad it is unbelievablewarning spoilerishits one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do he is a lawyer for christs sake why when his children go missing does he not call the police oh yes it is because all the police hate lawyers so they are just ignore him and let him be attacked when he is arrested for murder they just let him go free he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home the police do not bother to try and find an escaped mental patient they do not bother to interview his daughter as for the ridiculous ending
i have come to realise from watching euro horror especially films made by cult luminary jess franco that you can not expect a plot that makes much sense however franco has gone overboard with this film and despite a surreal atmosphere and the films reputation as one of the directors best succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film i have got to admit that i saw the american cut version which runs at about 76 minutes but unless it was just the logic that was cut i am sure the longer european version is just as boring the plot has something to do with a woman marauding around practicing sm and talking rubbish and it is all really boring there is no gore and the sex is dull and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film i had difficulty making it all the way to the end i have to say that the locations look good and franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere but the positive elements end there jess franco is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films but this looks like it was one he made for the money and overall i recommend skipping it and seeing some of the directors more interesting works
0 510 this movie has absolutely nothing good about it the acting is among the worst i have ever seen what is really amazing is that everyone is awful not just a few here and there everyone the direction is a joke the low budget is hopelessly evident the score is awful i would not say the movie was edited brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase it combines serial killings voodoo and tarot cards dumb dumb dumb it is not scary at all the special effects are hopelessly lame laughably bad throughout the writing was appallingly bad the cinematography is real cheap looking and very grainy sometimes and the camera work is dreadful again what really does the movie in is how badly all the actors are cheesy
brief summary this movie demeans everyone it touches that means you first off let me say i am not a purist and this might have been funny for a few minutes the impersonations are not bad but overall it is just dull and excruciatingly not funny a few simple jokes are repeated over and over again it is clear that this movies only exists to squeeze the last few dollars out of the now trademarked laurel and hardy the producers cannot have any real regard for their place in film history or their talents this is what offended me the most of course my daughter liked it so i am also a failure as a parent 
i just sat in the theater bored as hell i wanted to leave halfway through the movie the plot is simple 4 samoan guys wreck weddings so they have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding yawn the thing that peeved me off the most was the so called crude jokes they were highly unfunny clichéd and thrown in your face to make you get into the already dull movie the acting was below average and i felt this movie just went on and on about nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot all in all one of the worse movies i have seen of 2006 unfunny bad acting just ugly well thank god a friend shouted me avoid
amen to magsel there was a lot of confusion going on first off how do you know which movie you are purchasing henry cele stars in every one of them i bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries what a letdown it would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped david hasselhoff spelling is ok for popcorn tv but he was not believable in this film where was his english accent and what is with the love story the movie was supposed to be about a young mans rise to military power not the slave ship captain getting jiggly with the english maiden looking for her daddy if i had paid more than 7 for this movie i would have to call the police because that would be a crime
i have just visited russian forum of our tv channel that had showed this film well 99 per cent of active russian audience is disappointed we wanted to see more true facts of our space achievements in this film but authors had in mind something else  we are big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here we are proud of all our space dreams real achievements on the one hand in this field and in science on the other hand so i would like to ask authors where is our lunohod and where the hell our mir station ah i am quite sure that lunohod events took place much earlier armstrongs walk on moon and to comment numerous technical and science mistakes i really have no time and enough space here se our constructive critics in russian forum on www 1tv ru
this film is overblown predictable pretentious and hollow to its core the settings are faithful to the era but self conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure the lingering over artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue tom hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as bruce willis did in harts war tom you can not give depth to a character simply by making your face blank the content did not warrant the histrionic acting by paul newman this is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing
aside from the horrendous acting and the ridiculous and ludicrous plot this movie was not too bad unfortunately that does not leave much movie not to suck do not waste your time on this film even if you find yourself suffering from insomnia as i did watch an infomercial instead
i do not recall walking out of a movie theater except this once not only that but i was with 7 friends and we all wanted to go an uninteresting plot characters made of clay violence with no point i did not care when the good guys died i did not care when the bad guys got it the fantasy and magic was laid on thick as liver pudding and there was no coherency in short fine entertainment if you happen to be spending an eternity in hell
may contain spoilers i say that but anyone savvy enough to be reading this can probably figure out every plot turn right from the start this is not a movie that i liked i did not hate it in the way of some movies that insult your intelligence but it all felt too predictable on its trudge to the requisite happy ending there were funny bits along the way to be sure but few were original at least it did not go for the gutter christina applegate looks fresh and ben affleck works hard their scenes together are actually the only redeeming feature everyone else is a cardboard cutout including surprisingly james gandolfini who must have made this as a favor to someone all in all it is a harmless but not inspiring 90 minutes
worst movie on earth i do not even know where to begin but i hope i can save another person from punishing themselves with this movie when it comes to acting and lighting this movie is similar to a bad porno without the sex the actors are some of the worst i have ever seen and could not have been worse even if they were trying to make a complete mockery of this movie the movie must have had a record breaking low budget which i am sure was wasted almost solely on the movies cover this movie has now become a running joke with friends of mine and has become the standard for comparing other garbage movies i would like to point of that no other movie even begins to compare i feel personally responsible for suggesting a friend and me watch this movie and am surprised she still considers me a friend after the torment i put us through do not see this movie
home alone 3 is one of my least favourite movies it is the cream of the crop or s if you tend to be more cynical as it ranks up or down there with stuff like battlefield earth and flinstones viva rock vegas in fact it could even be worse than those two since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity this just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling no other movie has made me cringe in pain now i will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious first off the plot is ridiculous it revolves around a chip in a remote control car  that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it dumb stuff the action that ensues is similar to that of the other two home alones with boobytraps and all but watching these boobytraps being executed is rather than being funny incredibly unpleasant to watch i did not laugh or even so much as smile once rather i cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid the bird rather than providing comic relief was unfunny and annoying the acting as done by a bunch of no names ranges from poor to atrocious there is not a single good performance here alex d linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid while the terrorists act and judging by their movie credits look as they have been hastily picked off the street and well that is it i can see some people saying man it is for the kids do not dis it man  well man kids may like this but they can get a hell of a lot better see monsters inc and toy story before even considering getting this out hell even scooby doo and garfield which suck see those reviews for more are better than this so in short this is an irredeemably atrocious movie this was clearly recycled for the money as it almost completely rips off the first two the only thing is it completely insults the first two as well no human kid or otherwise should find any reason to see home alone 3 ever it is that bad 05 stars
it is hard to believe that this is a sequel to henry fool hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies while henry fool is refreshing witty comical fay grim is slow boring and does not go anywhere where has the wit gone i am baffled it is 10 years since i saw henry fool and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory fay grim is painful to watch this is no fault of the actors who are good parker posey or great jeff goldblum the blame lies entirely with the plot the dialog and even some of the filming low budget is no excuse a huge disappointment sorry i could not pay attention to the plot i was so bored so disappointed if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy henry fool so much the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other there is no continuity in the characters personalities it is all a fraud to entice fans of henry fool to watch the sequel i am switching this off now henry in some sort of jail with a taliban
absolutely one of the worst movies of the year the plot is ridiculous the characters poorly developed and the premise irritatingly stupid it all begins when michael keaton fresh off of doing nothing noteworthy since batman loses his beautiful author wife anna to a car accident possibly caused by her driving one of those convertible vw bugs even though she is supposed to be rich in his grief batman moves to a new apartment and takes up a hobby recording nothing and then watching it he learned this from a really fat pathetic guy who got murdered by three tall shadowy fellows who lived in his tv pretty soon he starts to see dead people thanks to evp or electronic voice phenomenon which is evidently this deal wherein dead people can send messages to living people through tape recorders video cameras dead cell phones anna cell calling but she is dead must be ghosts mhmmm no other possible explanation i would better start messing around with this indiscriminately  etc why they can not just write something down on a piece of paper or knock over some stuff to form creative pictograms is never explained anyway eventually batman discovers that he is actually seeing the future and he decides to go help this woman he does not know he gets out of his house just in the nick of time because the tall dark guys enter just after he leaves dmn it can travel between the living and dead using electronics but i will be dmned if we can be on time am i right guys they nod in bemused agreement  he tracks this lady to a warehouse and finds out that this character from the first ten minutes of the movie look hard or you will miss him is actually a serial killer working for three tall shadowy demons who in raiders of the lost ark style swoop down and kill him looking like the cartoons that they are just then some detectives show up and save the lady after batmans funeral he decides to send a message from beyond the grave apologizing to his son for being an idiot evidently feeling that the best way to protect his kid from the horrors of evp is to expose him to it the little kid just smiles nothing phases that dude not even when his dad batman of course starts talking to tvs the high point of the movie was when someone is phone rang and some guy yelled out it is anna
you will notice that the chemist who appears in two scenes and gets to speak is played by stephen king do not give up your day job is the standard thing to say but that is not fair king acquits himself reasonably well he is no worse than any other member of the cast and better than most the story on the other hand is pure rubbish please give up your day job never have i seen so many dreadful performances of which the lead actors the lead actors is probably the worst gathered together in the one film everyone acts hammily but not in any entertaining way they all somehow manage to go over the top without expending or manifesting energy i blame screenwriterdirector tom holland it can not be that all the actors are really this bad what are the odds against that admittedly i have never heard of any of them before but still i do not think i could walk into a talent agency and walk out with this many bad performers if i tried one actor despite my best efforts would turn out to have talent so what is more likely that tom holland rolled a dozen consecutive snake eyes or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it poorly that would also explain why actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in the script the more direction an actor got the worse he performed you want me to bend over like a hunchback talk from the back of my throat show all my teeth and look bored all at the same time okay this theory is confirmed by the fact that holland undeniably managed to co write a lousy script several writers here have commented on the fact that billy halleck is not a likeable character but that is a misleading way of putting it he is not a knowable character all we find out about him before the supernatural stuff starts happening is that he is fat and that all he can think about is food all i can think about is food he tells us helpfully  and in the end sigh i suppose i ought insert a spoiler warning here in the end he becomes evil why i can only shrug perhaps he is under some kind of enchantment yeah that is probably it by evil perhaps i mean inexplicable it is not so much badness as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary means end psychology anyway his actions at the end make no sense nobodys actions make much sense and this is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audience by the way here is my nominee for hammiest linedelivery i do not think you would like it in fact  big dramatic pause  i do not think you would like it at all 
twenty years ago the five years old boy michael hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later on the present days michael gordon currie invites his girlfriend peg stacy grant and his best friends chris myc agnew jennifer emmanuelle vaugier lisa ann kelly benson ned brendon beiser mitch maldive phillip rhys and trish rachel hayward to spend the halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm he asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear and together with his indian friend crow byron chief moon they would perform an ancient indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy morty jon fedele that would eliminate their fears forever the greatest fear of michael is to become a serial killer like his father but something goes wrong and morty turns into his father killing his friends the fear resurrection is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows but in a messy screenplay full of clichés there are some exaggerated performances like for example ms betsy palmer others very weak but in general the acting is good unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live further in spite of being surrounded by close friends the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies the low pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation in the very end michael shows a charm that his father was interested that i have not noticed along the story i do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the dvd released in brazil with 87 minutes running time the special effects are very reasonable for a b movie my vote is four title brazil fear 2 uma noite de halloween fear 2 one night of halloween
i watched this movie last night and already i am struggling to recollect very much about it the story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony they fly to the moon in a space age dustbin carrier when there they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the moonbase it strikes me that rubbish low budget sci fi films often involve either desert planets or like this movie criminals escaping from penal colonies why this is i have no idea but i can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical this one is really no exception it begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half way alright dance music soundtrack it then degenerates into a boring sci fi thriller so little of consequence actually happens in this movie that i am literally struggling to write a helpful review so if you are reading this i apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the films subtleties and nuances for the record i recall a tedious bunch of baddies a tedious bunch of goodies some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman other than that i am struggling if you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then i would not hesitate to recommend this film i would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets
this was truly dreadful it had a terrible storyline was poorly acted and was like an amateur remake of evil dead but not nearly as good it took all my tenacity to make it through this one it is a good job i did not have to visit the toilet else i doubt i would have come back this one makes hammer house of horror look like a big screen hollywood epic the only value to this movie was the never ending supply of beautiful women not a bad one among them if you want to letch with your friends after a night on the beer then this ones for you else avoid it like the plague
the film is bad there is no other way to say it the story is weak and outdated especially for this country i do not think most people know what a walker is or will really care i felt as if i was watching a movie from the 70s the subject was just not believable for the year 2007 even being set in dc i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end most did not stay for the qa either i do not think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just did not know how to finish them he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on i really did not get woodys carter private life or boyfriend either what were all the artistic male bondage and torture pictures from iraq prisons about what was he thinking i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woodys character car it did not work it did not even seem to make sense really the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson he played his character car flawlessly you really did get a great sense of what a walker may have been like say twenty years ago he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it as for lauren lily and kristin boring do not see it it is painful unless you are a true harrelson fan
nightmare weekend is proof positive that some people are so desperate to be in the movies they are prepared to do almost anything i am not referring to the countless women who seem quite happy to appear completely starkers in this dreadful piece of trash after all the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of no i am talking about those who are more than willing to co star with a badly made hand puppet called george now that is embarrassinga bio electronic being created by brilliant scientist edward brake wellington meffert george who looks like a demented felt clown with green wool for hair is the artificially intelligent interface for an advanced computer system that operates a revolutionary device a silver sphere about the size of a golf ball that when ingested can reverse character disorders edwards personality altering experiments have been successful on lab animals but the cautious scientist is reluctant to carry out tests on human subjects fearing that there may still be side effects his evil assistant julie debbie laster however has no such qualms and proceeds to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs inevitably they all turn into hideous killer mutants with bargain basement special effects a cast totally devoid of talent and a plot that is almost impossible to follow i took notes as i watched the film and even then i am not entirely convinced that my synopsis is accurate nightmare weekend is a complete and utter disaster that not even several soft core sex scenes and a touch of gore can rescue this film also features one of the most irritating characters i have ever seen in a horror movie tony bruce morton a walkman wearing idiot who bops away to crap 80s music in a manner that makes me look like justin timberlake in comparison
here is why the jane show will not work once again canadian bonehead producers and writers can not create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it i guess these people do not watch a lot of t v from the you s which has the sitcom model down pat no here we have to do something different we have to make the a story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful b story to try to make up for it the characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top forklift races give me freaking break here is a little advice for the writers of the show do not write funny situations find the funny in situations and remember you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff not just be an improv monkey
okay maybe not all of it lured by the false promise of bikini clad women on the movies cover but the horror the horror whatever you do do not watch this movie gouge out your eyes repeatedly bash your skull in do what it takes never again never forget
a truly unpleasant film while rick bakers special effects are quite impressive if stomach turning it has no other redeeming features like many 70s movies it leaves you feeling as if you need to take a long shower and scrub the slime off of yourself the characters are uniformly unpleasant and plot makes no sense
i was a huge fan of the original cartoon series and was looking forward to finally seeing gadget on the big screen but i never in my wildest dreams expected something so extremely extremely terrible the pace was way too fast there was no plot and wowser what the hell is that it was wowsers
this movie is so bad i knew how it ends right after this little girl killed the first person very bad acting very bad plot very bad moviedo yourself a favour and do not watch it 110
the premise is amazing and the some of the acting notably sally kellerman and anthony rapp is charming but this film is near unwatchable the music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap most of the singing is off key i think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it the dialogue is really stupid and trite the movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub plots i found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering when is it ever going to end 
wow i do not even really remember that much about this movie except that it stunk the plots basically a girls parents neglect her so this sicko pokemon pretends to be her dad am i the only one disturbed by that then this weirdo pokemon kidnaps ashs mom to pretend to be the girls i do not care if he was trying to make the girl happy that is just gross there was no real plot the girl was just a whiny brat who wanted things her own way she played with unowns was the daughter of entei and apparently could grow and shrink in age on a whim with the help of her dad that is pretty much all i can remember but i think you can take it as a hint and not see it or if you do see it do not expect much  1 out of 10 seriously if you want a pokemon movie rent pokemon the first movie
the pallbearer is a disappointment and at times extremely boring with a love story that just does not work partly with the casting of gwyneth paltrow julie gwyneth paltrow walks through the entire film with a confused look on her face and its hard to tell what david schwimmer even sees in her however the pallbearer at times is funny particularly the church scene and the group scenes with his friends are a laugh but that is basically it watch the pallbearer for those scenes only and fast forward the rest trust me you are not missing much
some funny bits but come bill a film quoting zeitgeist keep the tv show and the interviews but a film i am probably overreacting but what a unnecessary provoking film i do not know i laughed disagreed agreed this film is very confusing and inconsistent bills a funny guy but also very cocky bills rhetoric is similar to bill hicks a brilliant comedian but like many comedians the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying i think that the major problem in this film is his lack of sensibility this might be just a personal taste but comedy that constantly demeans somebody cannot be taken as truth bill is obviously emotionally reactive to religious fundamentalism i agree with bill that religious fanaticism is not sensible but the response to it cannot be sensible it will create unnecessary turmoil we can do better than just react to fundamentalism his conclusion is that we do not know and he fervently tries to convince the spectator that nobody knows anything to the point that the agnostic community has been concerned with his lack of serious research in comparative religion his humility that he only knows that he does not is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non sense i had great trouble seeing bits of zeitgeist the movie in bills film all the astrotheology influenced non sense that simplifies all religions as the same is simply disappointing zeitgeist has provoked a lot of controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable religion studies scholarship it is very sad how wrong facts have been tossed around with no reliable scholarly sources astro mystic sources that reduce everything to the stars say it all seem to be from the middle ages this film is a confusing statement from a confused agnostic agnosticism is far more complex and philosophically academic than defending every single issue as we do not know this film is an obvious proof of how postmodernism has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in human history watch the film it has hilarious interviews and bits but please do not behave like bill you cannot expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic comments in every other line his arguing techniques are demeaning and insulting provoking emotional reactions rather than rational and logical argumentation there needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues
that is not just my considered verdict on this film but also on the bulk of what has been written about it now do not get me wrong here either i am not a total philistine i did not hate the movie because it was not enough like police academy 9 or whatever i enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff i swear magnolia is poor and i am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed long winded self indulgent rambling nonsense from start to finish there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie there is some high calibre actors fair enough and none turns in an average or worse performance furthermore my wife a self confessed tom cruise hater tells me it is his career best performance by far but the plot is so completely unengaging meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snails pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something it does not help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with well i did not think so but i do not like most people admittedly they all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route yadda yadda yadda the soundtracks dire as well with that marrow suckingly irritating quality that i had hitherto thought unique to the music of alanis morisette all in all it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of friends whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat the bit with the frogs is good though
this movie commits what i would call an emotional rape on the viewer the movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in cannes but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence drug abuse or juvenile delinquency or any other issue for that matter the main characters metamorphosis from good but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent whereas the rape scene being an over dragged exaggerated version of the rape scene from a clockwork orange is unbearable and i refuse to comment on its aesthetic values there are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve hisher goal at least in my opinion to wrap it up shockingly brutal revolting and not worth your time see a clockwork orange or le pianiste instead
i honestly have to say that i could not stop watching this movie from the second that it started simply for how bad it was it is kind of like watching paint dry only a lot more confusing i mean you sit there and just wait for something to happen anything in fact preferably something that makes the whole film make sense at the end of the film i actually sat there wondering if there was any chance at all that i may have missed the first hour that explained everything or whether i may have inadvertently passed out during the film and missed the parts that glued the plotif there was in fact onetogether the main thing that really confused me about this movie is nearly at the end the main girl if there was indeed a main girl was in some sort of alternate reality i mean what the hell was going on at this point all of a sudden she awoke and was in a mental institute chained to a bed being drugged by doctors or something then quicker than it would have taken me to slit my wrists it flipped back and she was getting eaten out by some random vampireit made no sodding sense i am tempted to email the makers and demand my time back i mean i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this rubbishi am kind of interested to know if the filmmakers themselves actually knew what it was all about just seemed someone had edited out all the bits that could have made it make sense though i think the film would have had to have been 4hrs long to make that happen i side completely with the other person who wrote the other review i was duped royally with this film by its title and that alone i am just so sodding grateful i did not actually buy the film no matter how many times iv seen it in the local pound shop you would have thought that would have given me a clue that the film was a complete pile of steaming movie rubbish but to be honest i think £1 was way too much money to spend on this film what a sodding huge waste of time and a good razor blade i mean i wish i oded its less painful than watching this film
i never understood why some people dislike bollywood films they have got charismatic actors great dance numbers and heightened emotion what is not to like what i did not realize was that i had only seen the upper crust of bollywood then i watched garam masala i could tell from the first scene that this was not a movie i was going to like the film opens with a montage of the two leads driving around a city and apparently happening serendipitously on a series of photo setups populated with gyrating models but i kept hoping things would improve sadly they did not the main problem is that the two protagonists mac  sam are completely unsympathetic they spend the entire movie lying to women and lying brutally in order to get them into bed and the audience is supposed to find this funny and be charmed the boys are unscrupulous and inept and not in a lovable way mac even goes so far as to have one of the women drugged in order to keep her from discovering his cheating the script is extremely poor with repetitive scenes setups that never lead to anything and illogical actions and statements by the characters in fact the characters are never really developed at all the males are boorish greedy jerks and the women merely interchangeably beautiful if you go by this movie you would think that air hostesses are pretty easy to pass from man to man in reality betrayal is not so humorous the only bright spots i found in the movie were one dance number that had brilliant sets and a few slapsticky moments involving the french farce door slamming aspects of the story but bollywood dancing is better enjoyed in movies choreographed by farah khan and for slapstick you might as well just go straight to the silent comedies of buster keaton and harold lloyd who seem to have influenced writerdirector priyadarshan not a little priyadarshan also takes false credit for inventing the story the basic premise of the plot is stolen from the 1960 play boeing boeing  the original author of that work marc camoletti is credited nowhere at least priyadarshan changed the title for this remake rather than brazenly using the original without giving credit as he did in his 1985 version of this same tale according to imdbs credits list 
you can never have seen either film and still know that the jerk too is a disaster the question is not how did it get made because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film they will do so no the question is why oh why did steve martin allow it to be made i think he needed the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined it not cost him anything he knew the sequel was going to be so frightful that out of pride he would not even count it is royalties as income the only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have had carl gottlieb and steve martin revive the nations favorite poor black family and dcreasy2001 aka mark blankfield it is just transparently obvious that you worked on this film in some sad capacity and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the sequels lone cheerleader as an imdb user comment i was praying for you to veer over into satire but alas you were really making an effort at spin why not 10 stars
demi moores character in the movie was selected for the seals because of her looks that was a bad start and the movie went down from there the plot was totally unbelievable the will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough this movie did not convince me of a womans physical ability to perform the types of tasks required trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone is intelligence the differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting
let us be honest shall we al gore no more truly cares about the environment than most folks care about contacting foot fungus it is a hook make no mistake al gore is a politician three years ago he was bustedticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving not a hybrid a yugo or even a gm metro but a lincoln go google it if you like or how about the fact that mr gore  his hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuel guzzling jets to attend the premiers of an inconvenient truth  so much for conservation huh al anyway it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at an inconvenient truth  discover the main fundamental flaw while the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the effects of supposed global warming there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed because of it for example i can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot  they can point out an automobile which is not running right but can they tell you with any degree of certainty why generally not a second flaw just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago the toilet was not even invented yet what did they have a june bug in a match box hell even 50 60 years ago therefore how do we know with any degree of certainty that the planet is getting warmer when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best or that man is the sole because of it the answer is we do not  science is never a consensus thirty years ago time magazine did a cover proclaiming a new ice age the truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in earth science will tell you that volcanic erruptions solar activity  el ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed global warming  finally what al gore fails to adequately address is even if america decides to follow the global gospel according to al  implement everything he recommends how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we can not even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism answer it is wishful thinking mr gore  you being a former vp of the usa know it if the folks who produced an inconvenient truth were really honest they would have titled their film al gore wants attention  but what i would really like is for someone to ask the former vp this why were two of the planets biggest polluters aka china  india exempt from abiding by the kyoto accords anyway i hear the producers of a i t are working on their next film entitled gnomes fairies  elves our endangered friends 
run away from this movie even by b movie standards this movie is dreadful it is also insidious in it is theme the main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are cool and worth admiring people who treat others with respect are losers guncrazy is a movie that speaks for the disenfranchised a lot better than this movie see it instead no normal kid would do what trent does state troopers do not work as they do in this film etc seeing this movie makes you realize why writers use the hooker with a heart of gold cliche mija is a completely unsympathetic hookerwho yes has had a terrible life however she is such a terrible person the audience cannot identify with her usually there is one thing a movie can be recommended for in this case there is none it is such a ridiculous movie it insults the person who tries to identify with the main characters the acting is adequate by b movie standards and the direction presents nothing new or interesting
if you do not mind having your emotions toyed with then you will not mind this movie on the other hand if you enjoy british crime mysteries following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end you will be very disappointed here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment  while the police utilize the cctv cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery the huge truck that stopped and blocked the childrens view just before her disappearance does not get caught on camera this is a critical piece of the mystery it is inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery  the movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the childrens movements but misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera visible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing clues  in england driving is on the left the director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right several meters away from the flower kiosk when it could have easily parked immediately behind or even on the side as the huge truck did  the police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime but can not find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene even though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfall  search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting  it is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kiosk  it is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators even coaxing her daughter to do the same while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home if she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential park  the suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slowdimwitted justifying his unknowingly drowning of the mother but he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self incriminate there are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true sleuth aficionados disappointment five days is a very weak british crime story
prom night 2 is an ok horror movie but prom night is way better and this movies about how the prom queen mary lou in 1957 gets killed by her boyfriend and comes back 30 years later for revenge the best actor in this movie is micheal ironside and the movie stars other ok actors and actress like justin louis iwendy lyonlisa schrage and richard monettei and there are some good gore scenes like when mary lou kills the girl that is trying to hide in her locker by crushing the lockers together and how one of the students are on the computer and mary lou electrocutes him to death over all this is an okgood horror movie and my rating is 4 out of 10
ugh what can i say other than ugh i rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original vampires this movie could not have been any lamer lacking not only in plot but the acting is atrocious combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch many times i questioned my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark here is a sampling of the lamer aspects spoilersprofessional slayer insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night he wakes up to a woman crying sitting no more than 3 feet from him in the middle of nowhere he immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance she goes from crying to seducing him and he let us it happen with obvious results one of the main characters is zoe was bitten by a vampire but as long as she takes these experimental pills she got in mexico city she is fine although her body temperature is below room temperature guard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires hero leaves the next day he then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left avoid this movie
this movie is like the material s e hinton was writing in the 1970s and copola was adapting to the screen in the early 80s and had trueblood actually been a product of either the results might have been much better especially in the acting department instead we get a rather so bad its funny piece of mediocrity jeff fahey plays ray trueblood a former street rumbler i suppose is the accurate description this was in the days of action movies that used guys in their 40s and mid30s and dressed them up in greaser threads or some kind of more effeminate selection of gang garb and they fought to lousy 80s music nonetheless ray is the lone caretaker of his younger brother donny chad lowe in a part where he screams a lot who he is forced to leave behind inexplicably in a train station when on the run from the cops he is nabbed and forced to serve time in the marines flash forward to present day and ray is back in town and looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gangs although in a gang that was rays adversary and now old scores must be violently settled and again cops must be dodged and this time a ladys honor defended in the action film sense before ray can carry on life at normal pace with his brother donny for the most part the film is quite ridiculous for me most of this has to do with far too much overacting although not by fahey or sherlyn fenn who plays the waitress he befriends the guys in the gang and lowe himself seem to do quite a bit of needless exaggerated as new york street toughs although the bigger hang up is recycled plot lines and perhaps a kind of movie that was well past its prime as a product of 1989
a number of brides are mysteriously murdered while at the altar and later their bodies are stolen en route to the morgue newspaper writer patricia hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings she discovers that right before each ceremony the bride was given a rare orchid supposedly from the groom which contained a powerful drug that succumbed them patricia is told that the orchid was first grown by a dr lorenz who lives in a secluded estate with his wife in reality dr lorenz is responsible for the crimes by putting the brides in a suspended state and using their gland fluid to keep his wife eternally young patricia along with dr foster who is working with dr lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife try to force dr lorenzs hand by setting up a phony wedding which eventually leads patricia into the mad doctors clutches this movie had a very good opening reel but basically ended up with too many establishing shots and other weak scenes the cast is decent walters and coffin deserved better but that is life russell steals the show even out hamming lugosi who does not give one of his more memorable performances even considering his monograms as countess lorenz playing the role with the qualities of many of the stereotypical characteristics of many of todays hollywood prima donnas weak and contrived ending as well rating based on b movies 4
this is a movie about making a movie such movies may be entertaining but they need some substance to do so it did not happen here i am afraid mr coppola did not inherit his fathers skills unfortunately neither did his sister who can however make movies which one might watch i do wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews let us see the lead male actor supposedly a director is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same pitch whatever he says the lead female actress has an expression on her face that never changes the plot is totally segmented in bits with perhaps one single connecting element the movie within the movie idea must be more stale than paleolithic rocks would that be enoughi regretted every single moment i watched this movie a walk with the dog is far superior entertainment to this unbelievably lame movie it is as if a françois truffaut plot were directed by dick cheney brazil some other classic sf movies you must be really joking
proof that not everything tarantino touches turns to gold this is most definitely plastic all the way its easy to see that without quentins involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years that is assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place it is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes angela jones is unconvincing in this role william baldwin is better as the serial killer who keeps jones in employment all in all pretty poor
brokedown palace is not the kind of movie i would ever like to see i also did not like the movie when some aussie man smuggled drugs in thailand and accused claire danes and kate beckinsale of drug smuggling i would not go to that country no matter what after i saw this movie in fact this movie stinks i prefer to visit germany to meet beautiful single women germany is the country i tolerate i also would rather stick to the united states instead after i saw some of the movie in the theatre including the false accusation of drug smuggling i left the theatre and had my money refunded because i cannot tolerate this movie if you are going to to thailand to meet someone there who could be a drug smuggler forget this
i have heard about this novel a long time ago many of my friends have recommend me to read it i searched it in every place and finally found it this is a book that every man should read because it is genius and because of it is vision i enjoyed every page i knew about the movie and could not wait to see it when i finally did i was very disappointed many things that are in the book are not in the movie i do not think that this is a spoiler that just makes the movie not logical michael radford might be a good director but a bad writer especially as a book adopter the movie is not dark at all the writing is really bad the only thing that is good even great is the acting john hurt is an amazing actor and the only face i myself could see as winston smith what angers me the most are the people in imdb that called this the best adaptation ever without even reading the book or knowing anything about screen writingyou can only understand the brilliance of the story by reading the book do not consider this as an alternative as a fan of the book i was very disappointed the points i gave for this movie goes for the acting
popeye and big foot  popeyes engine company  getting popeyes goat 12i used to lap these up as a kid but catching an episode of the series comprising three cartoons back to back now i e several years later they preceded the theatrical screening of the pirate yarn raiders of the seven seas 1953 i can see how they do not hold up all that well the character of popeye is not exactly sympathetic to begin with olive oyl distinctly overbearing and blutos antics failed to elicit much interest either in short the scripts were alarmingly thin fairly awful and generally unfunny to boot they are strictly juvenile fare yet i doubt todays kids would even have the patience to stick with them furthermore the animation style is unattractive taking each short per se i guess they improved from one to the other after the initial shock one adapted to its mediocre quality as it were so that the third cartoon easily results in being the most enjoyable of the lot  popeye is entrusted with a mascot army goat whose immense appetite causes him no end of mischief hardly original i know but always an amusing ploy one interesting element here was that the shorts were bookended with popeye delivering moralistic bits of wisdom to the kids in the audience
do not be mistaken this is neither a horror nor really a film i firmly advise against watching this 82 minute failure the only reason it merited a star was the presence of chris pine nothing happens you wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of a twist a hint of surprise a plot to emerge but no the characters take erratic turns of pace in their actions and yet do not have the time to develop thanks to the thrifty editors and frankly ashamed writers before returning to an idyllic and playful bring on the teen rock montage state the only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable token ethnic companion their encounters with obstacles be they human or physical are brief confusing and entirely pointless chris pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast lou taylor pucci could not be dryer if he spent the summer with keanu reaves combing the navada desert watch the road watch 28 days later watch day time tv anything but this i implore you suffer the boredom unlike you may be led to believe in the film this film is no cure
this horrendously bad piece of trash manages to be racist sexist and homophobic all at once while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated atrocious performances a cliche ridden screenplay and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of two scenes were especially offensive the one in which schaech scrubs his tongue after being kissed by another man could it really have been that gross and the scene where eastwood is kissed by schaechs best friend who is pretending to be russian after he leaves the room she exclaims fking foreigners so much for her being a cultured artist who dreams of living in parisjonathon schaech can be a likeable actor on screen and is astonishingly good looking it is a shame he did not learn more from working with cutting edge gay director gregg araki on an earlier film and try to salvage this film from descending into a string of gay stereotypes and a mire of homophobia
the monster from enemy mine somehow made his way into a small mountain community where he has taken up residence he is being hunted by a female doctor turned vigilante who is out to exterminate him this female assassin who looks like a refugee from a motley crue video rides around on a motorcycle and tries to save a bunch of kids who have chosen to have a big chill weekend right smack dab in the middle of the monsters turf decapitations and lots of blood are primarily in place to draw attention away from the story which limps along like a bad version of the island of dr moreau and yes it is worse than the one with val kilmer
i am a big time horrorsci fi fan regardless of budget but after watching countless horror movies late night on cable and video this has to be the worst of all movies with bloody special effects what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that kept being shown over and over again and people running around screaming from left then to right then back again it should have stayed with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes instead it is dragged out very long it is very very x5 low budget many scenes were way way too long narrator sounded very amateurish like a random person out of junior high was talking this is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than manos red zone cuba benjiand godzilla vs megalon despite their higher budgets 10 snoozes try to stay awake through whole movie in one setting or better yet avoid it like you would an undead brain eating mob the why did i ever see this piece of zombie dung blues epitome of nauseatingly bad made movies etc ad infinitum infinity10
what kind of sht is this power rangers vs freddy it was watchable and as good as the first film in the beginning but from the part where the protagonists get super powers in theirs dreams it started to become childish this sht should have been rated pg or pg 13 rather than r i expected to see some very mature stuff but it was only for the 13 of the film the rest are for little kids plus it is focused too much on christianity i know freddys a demon but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons why does it always have to be christianity this is total orientalism and filled with white menwesterners superiority do not watch this show it to little kids who loves power rangers
because others have gone to the trouble of summarizing the plot i would like to mention a few points about this film there may be spoilers here i do not care enough to filter them out given the films low budget the creature design was quite good it is actually nice to see a direct to video horror film that is not slathered with awful cgi unfortunately the digital film qualitys quite grainy in places and it is most noticeable in the well lit white halls of the asylum ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this film to say nothing of the variations in the passage of time i understand the director might have been trying to simulate dementia but in order for this to be effective consistent time flow needed to be established as is it merely seems amateurish plot twists were numerous but consistently predictable i neither had a doubt in my mind of the identity of the robed cultists nor of the fact that some kind of lame evil trumps good development would surface at the end this may seem like quibbling but characters in this film reliably fail to employ any kind of common sense first of all regulatory commissions would be all over a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee deaths cardiac arrest induced why would the head psychiatrist also be capable of performing autopsies why was not a plot point made of these impressive qualifications or of his introduction to his odd choice of religion what is the background what is supposed to make us care about anyone in this and just as importantly who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place see everything that was so frighteningly wrong with it and then conclude that it was still a fine place to pursue a residency this film did not even respect its characters enough to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubt bottom line see the wicker man instead
really an amazing pile of pap a predictable slow moving soul destroying mind numbing movie to which slitting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems well almost necessary the acting is over done for the thin dialogue every scene is at least twice as long as it needs to be the intricate details of how this career is collapsing or that career is rising is just far too dreary and mundane for words the music would be good if you did not have to sit through the movie but really three good songs is not enough reward for the effort required to watch the movie watching this film i prayed to god for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me never ever ever again
this movie is simply not worth the time or money spent full of clichés and a plot that makes absolutely no sense  i can not believe that so many people have given this awful movie a 10 my guess is they are stooges of the movie maker if i could give this movie a zero i would too bad imdb does not allow that the only reason i watched it because i went with a friend who really wanted to see it what is sad is that i never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet i felt short changed take my word do not waste your 8 on this piece of trash the only entertainment i got out of the movie was making fun of the directors name in all highly not recommended 
a very bad attempt at a young spinal tap at least the music in spinal tap was good this is really a very sad case of hollywood nepotism at it is worst a bunch of hollywood execs bad musicians and producers create some poopie show so their kids can be in the spotlight oh please the potty humor was even bad i hate this stuff when there is really incredibly talented kids musicians actors and artists out there busting their butts to have success and this crap comes along help you all why was not gene simmons in it ameriacs taste in entertainment is going down the toilet
i went to see this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because i liked bruce dern in silent running and family plot to this day sorry jack nicholson it is still the dullest movie i have ever seen it just went on and on with no discernible point and then it just ended the lights came up and i watched everyone looking around in confusion had the projectionist missed a reel i have never had the urge to find out all i remember about the movie is that it was a non drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach the most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the totally mystified audience afterwords fortunately this was just an exception for jack bruce and karen black
the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters the different story lines do not feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times it may sound weak and cliché but it is true you are way better of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and terri irwin it is more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is i am sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie does not give us the viewers much pleasure for a comedy it simply is not funny enough and steve and terri irwin just are not good actors not even when they play themselves their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scenes feel long distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times the movie had quite some potential i mean steve irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch so when i first heard that they were making a movie about the crocodile hunter my first reaction was brilliant the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters the movie does has a certain entertainment value at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still i must certainly would not recommend this movie watching this movie felt like a waste of time still this movie might be watchable just once when it gets on tv on a rainy afternoon it does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential 410
i have seen a lot of crap in my day but goodness hot rod takes the cake i saw a free screening in ny the other night i can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers the big laughs were sparse the plot was uninteresting and the characters were one dimensional at best one highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with adam samberg it was priceless and was the only scene i truly had a hearty laugh at other than that i can only recollect randomness and dead air snl  samberg fans may be disappointed i know i was expecting more from it but it short i definitely would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this film
i gave this movie a very fair chance and it betrayed me this is very little more than a black and white excuse to bore the hell out of the audience even as the egotist bogdanavich who did way better with targets gets great performances out of a ton of hams in their debuts lots of teenage sex clichés come out of this movie such as doing the teachers wife impotence doing the ugly prostitutewhich is very awkwardly shot and grinds things to a complete halt not that things were really going anywhere anyway and skinny dipping i suppose this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the sex nonsense to me it was just annoying i was seriously much more entertained by cleaning my finger nails than watching this mess
to be honest i did not watch all of the original howling but those scenes i saw made it obvious that the first howling was a great movie so great that seven horrible sequels had to be made they started off with howling ii your sister is a werewolf i got this movie on vhs from my uncle sometime ago when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when atari was brand new i just watched it last night and it was not really bad it was just weird i mean the whole thing with sybil danning going three way with two of her werewolf minions was just out of place and quite disturbing but kind of hot christopher lee about to stab a dead karen as if she is a vampire etc actually this movie was actually like some sort of mish mash of dracula and the lost boys except with werewolves because everything christopher lee whom played dracula himself was saying about werewolves pretty much ripped off from every other vampire movie stake in the heart garlic the creature of the night must die at night and the ruler of werewolves lives in transylvania not much for the acting but the worst of it came from annie mcenroe i swear at some point in the film i found myself rooting for the werewolves to rip her throat out because that damn throat always had to say something anyway the plot is pretty silly and clichéd so there is no real point in telling you you could just read about it on wikipedia by the way the thing that really makes me nauseous about this movie is the fact that it is the only film out of all the seven sequels that is related in any way to the original not counting howling iv 1988 which was a remake of the original or in other words a sequel based on the same novel so do not see this movie there is no real horror hardly any werewolves and just horrible special fx 310
from the awful death scenes to guns that fire without making sounds to a character called the fiend it is all tiresome slow moving unimaginative drivel it was ok seeing the guy with the cape and the hunchback lurking around visually it was creepy and probably occupied the moviegoer of the time but even in 1936 one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a film like this i just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were posing at an office picnic and then there are those bullets as a previous commentator mentioned perhaps the best clue would have been to search for a water spot on someone is pants pocket
when i saw this movie cover the first thing i thought was that it was made for video the second thing that came to mind was how similar this looked to another terrible movie darkness falls the tale of this dumb witch who killed people in the dark unfortunately darkness falls was quite the masterpiece compared to this pile of garbage and this movie should not have been made the film starts off with a small back story for the witch or more like a pointless introduction of two little kids who are going to go meet the tooth fairy in hopes of her giving them a shiny new bicycle for their tooth the opening is filmed poorly and like the rest of the movie it is certainly not scary in present time the movie is about peter lochlyn munroe peters renting out his house and his ex girlfriend darcy chandra west and her daughter cole come to stay there cole meets a neighborhood child and they talk of the tooth fairy and how you should not lose your tooth or she will come for you unfortunately seconds later it looks like the tooth fairy steals her bike and knocks her tooth out how ironic will cole survive the wrath of the tooth fairy and will her mother and peter be able to save her and rekindle their romance this is a bad movie you could probably figure it out one of the main problems with this idiotic film is how undefined the tooth fairy is they say she kills you if you lose your tooth but nope she is more like a serial killer who kills at random and if you lose your tooth you are definitely going to go she steals a bike so apparently she is a thief too i said earlier that the idea for this movie was based on darkness falls but where did they get the inspiration for the tooth fairys appearance let us see she looks like a burn victim and she previously went around the neighborhood slaughtering children hmmm it is almost as though she is an exact rip off of freddy krueger from the nightmare on elm street films and this is not the worst part of this awful mess the climax is this movie might have the most laughable climax not literally laughable because i found it more sickening than funny i have ever seen do not see this just a little trivia lochlyn munroe was in scary movie and jianna ballard was in scary movie 3 and they both were in this so apparently scary movie stars are forced to end out their career with bad scary movies my rating 12 out of  80 mins r for violence
spoilers first off nothing really happened in this movie other than a woman bleeding inexplicably second it was not scary third it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever let me elaborate the sound was edited by either beavis or butthead  i am not sure which so let us just go with beavis the movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the people mumble and mutter forcing you to turn up the volume i watched this at home then beavis blasts some really loud sounds with supposedly scaryshocking images forcing you to quickly lower the volume again this occurs many times until mercifully the movie ends i can picture beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the two way mirror while watching the test group franticly reaching for the remote each time if you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep this one is a big mistake but then it is a big mistake anyway here is a thought  if you are going to make a horror movie at least add a gratuitous beheading a 19 year old blond girl who screams at the top of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater the shadow on the wall of someone being eaten alive just out of the camera range a cat being thrown at the camera to scare the audience some drifty weirdo with a maniacal laugh or a monster who looks like a stage hand covered in aluminum foil a la tvs lost in space these people did not even try to scare me they just wanted to hurt my ears
i caught this movie on fx last night and as i was sitting there watching it it occurred to me that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever bad acting bad cinematography bad sound totally unbelievable fight sequences stupid characters all these made it up to be the most laughably bad movie i have ever seen it was so bad i was enthralled by it is sheer lack of anything semi competent that i had to keep watching and they made a sequel
the original thunderbirds earned a place in tv history it was and still is much beloved indeed the entire first 10 minutes of the wallace and gromit movie the wererabbit is a direct lift of thunderbirds down to a direct replay of the original thunderbird 2 launching sequence if you do not believe me get the movie and then get a copy of the original episode where thunderbird 2 is launched this movie was a crass attempt at making a kids movie when the original was loved and enjoyed by kids and adults alike in the original the thunderbirds spent all of their time rescuing people who were often trapped when mother nature or technology went horrible wrong yes there was also the occasional criminal act the thunderbirds put their own lives and resources at risk for no reward the very essence of heroism and selflessness there was little physical violence the thunderbirds challenged the imagination to a degree how many of us would dream of someday building a thunderbird 2 and do not underestimate the power of entertainment to do this many japanese attribute their fascination with humanoid robots to the old astroboy cartoon but this movie was a poor re image of the original this movie came across as a meld between thunderbirds and loony tunes i mean we have anthony edwards as brain imitating porky pigs stuttering much of the action consists of kung fupower rangers type fighting indeed there were funny sound effects when someone got nailed on the head with a frying pan the tech that fired our imagination was absent instead we have these kids running around using a plot device that was never in the original series having the entire team take off at once leaving the base occupied by the kids and brain then there was a dose of use the force luke mysticism thrown in when tintin would levitate something or another coupled with the the hood using aerodynamics that looked like they were lifted from crouching tiger hidden dragon about the only thing missing was for the hood to go tintin i am your uncle with a breath mask voice the heart that made thunderbirds unique was gone the only bright point was ron cooks portrayal of parker he caught it perfectly but the actress playing lady penelope came across as a child huh and this is why we hate this movie when someone puts out something that was popular to a fan base and expects the fans to she will out money to watch and then delivers something than was not even close to what the fans expect well i am sorry that is just plain wrong ok so if they were making a kids movie fine next time distribute it straight to video where many of these belong but do not package something up in a familiar wrapper and change the innards
they had such potential for this movie and they completely fall flat in the first cruel intentions we are left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do there is almost no character development whatsoever in this prequel it is actually a very sad story but this film did nothing for me it was as if they left out good writing in place of unneeded f words and the end makes absolutely no sense and does not explain anything the writing was just terrible another thing that bothered me was that they used at lease 3 of the exact same lines that were in the original such as down boy or the kissing scene and a few others i can not remember i was not impressed at all by robins acting but amy did a great job that is about the only thing that reconciled this movie
gorgeous bodies gorgeous colors and camera work pretentious dialog banal plot the name of the prima donna camilla and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently are enough to remind us of the plot similarities from dumas novel la dame aux camelias the movie camille starring garbo and i think robert taylor and last but not least verdis opera la traviata beautiful not too virtuous young ladies social outcasts for one reason or another loved split up reunited just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene one forgives banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialog in opera but why waste hayak don sutherland a beautiful rendition of la in the 30s a deus ex machina earthquake that conveniently kills the other woman and all that beauty on this mediocre turkey where there is not even any beautiful singing
artemesia takes the usual story about the art world eg you can not paint that but i want to and plasters it with sex and scandal to make the whole film well interesting but not remarkable the story is about one of the first female painters around artemesia who course is fiercely independent but just can not stop thinking of men and their bodies
wow i remember so many awful films that loosely revolved around high school from the early 1980s they usually had someincredibly strained plot and lots of 27 year old actors pretending to be students as i watched this film i felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s however then i find out that this film was made in 1989 say what well the nostalgia factor ends right there this is just bad the plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools which is odd in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant in fact the main character lives in a mansion makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive have they never heard of property taxes oh but here is the kicker the school board says that they will keep the school alive if the students can raise 200000 so the seniors go about doing this hmmm you raise 200000 but instead of saving that for college you put it towards saving the high school that you are a senior in and why exactly would they close an overpopulated school before the year is out and ahh forget it this film was stupid and made in 1989
what was steven seagal thinking i mean firstly i love seagal i love all his movies up to the mid 2000s his early stuff is some of the best in the genre this however does not live up to its excellent name attack force with protagonist marshall lawson seagal would be expected to be a mindless action movie with seagal in typical one liner ass kicking form however what we get is a crime mystery bordering on a political thriller with little or no action seagal is always in shadows because of his weight i could not follow this story there is people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug what happened in this movie the dubbing of seagal is a disgrace a shambles and a shame why dub the man the story is terrible this got a 210 from me because of the scene where seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera revenge is a two way street seagal says in this movie well forget revenge steven you need redemption
major league back to the minors 1998 ½ starring scott bakula eric bruskotter corbin bernsen dennis haysbert jensen daggett written and directed by john warren 100 minutes rated pg 13 for language and some violence by blake french believe it or not in the new john warren comedy major league back to the minors there is one funny scene it consists of a sequence where an infuriated coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the cement and bounce back and smash him in the face it is not much but with the exception of a few one liners it is all this film has to offer enough said this movie is not only structurally impaired characteristically undeveloped predictable and badly written but also just plain bad even non critical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got it is so familiar it just is not funny how many times does the same movie about sports have to be made last years we saw this same material in air bud golden receiver and as bad as that film was this is even worse at least air bud was family oriented major league back to the minors is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a sunday afternoon it is too childish for adults so who is this film for teenagers elderly people who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this the film like many others like this has one basic point it tries to make teamwork conquers all yes it does and what a great moral to try to prove too bad we have already seen and excepted it so many times over and over have such little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in a ballerina costumes where the silly announcers form their own buddy comedy routine muttering one liners to themselves like they suck this kids fast ball is timed with an hour glass this guy dropped out of ball for a while to find something he lost maybe it was his mind somebody needs a nap and ever see a sunset as beautiful as that play  where the characters have such little significance to each other that we never know them by name and where the only heartfelt lecture scene about teamwork is so unknowledgeable that it is almost funny major league back to the minors is so bad it stalls its trite ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence the good baseball team is on a comeback they are about to win and the power goes out i was thinking for a minute that this piece of trash had come to a conclusion but in reality its false final scene exists only to add minutes to the running time the movie basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw in so many putrid jokes it is are not funny there is another kind of funny line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long time outfielder is not wanted in that position any longer the coachs answer you are too old too slow and too fat  the players reaction is to die for but that scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of you time and certainly is not worth a cent of your money so here is another dreadful entrée into this genre of film another that is doomed with its own script which is failed before seen and another which is so familiar it seems like deja vu all over again
okay so i went into this movie not really expecting much i figured an action flick similar to the fast and the furious some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot unfortunately i would have to say that this was probably the worst movie i have seen this year do not get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were ok but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely the story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together so overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend i would pass on this one for now
this oddity in the new doris day collection does not really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes what she does do however is shine when she is on screen the near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some warner contract players of the day jancie rule shows promise and it is a shame she did not become a big star ruth roman handles the role of the go getter with aplomb better if this was in color the travis air force base locations with some rear projection work well what is best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes if you enjoyed thank your lucky stars and hollywood canteen you will like this one
i did not agree with any of the theology in the left behind series but nonetheless i found the books gripping and i read 8 of 12 of them undeniably good writing and interesting story however i did not have very high expectations for the movie there was no way mainstream hollywood would have taken up a christian series and produced a big budget movie so it was done independently and it just felt like i was watching a really long tv show it just did not feel like a movie it did not have that movie experience to it if anybody knows what i am talking about so the movie suffered because of that and the low budget poor special effects were another detraction for me on top of that i feel that gordon currie was woefully miscast as nicolie carpathia reading the book my impression of nc was that he was supposed to be this charming dazzling amazingly handsome guy who spoke english with almost zero trace of an accent so i imagined somebody like pierce brosnan in the role instead they found some clay aiken pencil neck who looks like an employee of the month from best buy and gave him a really bad fake accent so that lost a few stars for me right there a movie is just not convincing when the major villain does not look or sound the way he is supposed to the acting was okay but nothing to write home about some of the scenes like one of the conversion scenes can not remember which one were real seat squirmers for me and some of the christian rock music or whatever it was was really out of place for some of the scenes like in the one with kirk cameron praying in the bathroom in short it was not a bad movie but it just did not do it for me stick to the book folks it is much better
it happened with assault on prescient 13 in 2005 it happened with the lost boys in 2008 and now it is happened with another classic from the 80s wargames  why oh why oh why will not hollywood ever learn leave them alone  they can not be remade  they suck  we all hate them  those of you who have not seen the original 1983 version with matthew broderick  ally sheedy go rentbuy it now  the hardware may look dated the special effects are not new millennium but it still beats this rubbish hands down for those of us who lived through the 80s when hacking was sexy the internet was something mysterious and your disks came as a 8 floppy variety well we now possess the wisdom to avoid this film like a thermonuclear war never before has a nice game of chess seemed the better option
unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under 5 minutes the plot even for a seagal film the plot is just stupid i mean its not just bad its barely coherent the acting unbelievably wooden literally seen better acting in pornos ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a lesbian love scene which is utterly cringe worthy special effects would not look out of place in a 60s sword and sorcery flick unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures do not make the same mistake as i did and buy this dvd as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back
the movie and acting are not bad and jay hernandez does a good job playing calito brigante but the movie forgets it is suppose to be a prequel to a hit movie the makers of this prequel clearly did not watch the original carlitos way or at least did not care about continuity this movie is a prequel which means the original movie has already laid out some history for us and this movie should end where the original begins or at least lead up to it not one of carlitos close old friends from the original make an appearance in this movie they are not even mentioned luis guzman pachanga in the original is in the movie but he plays a completely different character the original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 1969 70 considering this movie takes place less than 5 years earlier would not you think one of carlitos long time friends would make an appearance in the original carlito starts out being released from jail after spending 5 years in jail that is only a few months between the end of the prequel and the start of the original semi spoiler we know from the beginning of the original carlito has spent 5 years in prison so when the prequel gives us this hollywood happy ending it is an insult to the intelligence of fans of the original what happen to gail it is the lack of continuity that made this film go direct to video release
ritchies first two films were snappy stylish entertainment here he raids two recent classics the usual suspects and fight club and still comes out empty handed despite parading itself as a con mystery with the sub usual suspects twaddle the greatest con he ever pulled was convincing you that he was you or whatever it was  and attempting a fight club twist about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half by the last third you know you are being lead down a blind alley and tediously slowly at that cons chess and game theory are all great subjects but ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material the only thing that keeps the movie almost watchable is ritchies bold way with with a scene and maurice joness dynamic camera if ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot and succumbed to tighter editing there is no reason why he could not have made another enjoyable gangster caper as it is revolver is a waste of your time incomprehensibility does not equal profundity if you want to see a great film that does not make logical sense but makes a virtue of it and incidentally which also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement watch lost highway
why of why did i pick this one up well i needed a no brainer in the summer heat and the cover looked cool of course i should have known better this is a really really bad movie and it gets embarasing when the makers know it is bad and try cover it up by adding some sexybeautiful women and some sex scenes to it well folks it doesnt cut it does itif you would like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very very good well played and funny go rent lake placid that is an order
the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike but are not in any way expect for being smart one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title i honestly did not like the style of the movie i believe that anxiety confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose but what i do not get is why there is so much of it the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all it gives the comic book like experience however it is visually numbing the viewer it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs monotonic scenes dynamic cut music and abrupt noises the movies storyline is very simple most of what is going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts i will say openly that this movie did not meet my expetations a tiny bit
this is a genuinely horrible film the plot such as it is is totally undecipherable i think it has something to do with blackmail but i am not entirely certain half of the dialogue consists of useless cliches the other half is spoken by the various actors in such unintelligible imitations of southern accents that thankfully the words cannot be recognized but the one true tragedy of the movie is that such a historic talent as mary tyler moore apparently was in such dire financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in it
despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in new zealand any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved apart from a clichés only plot the movie is let down by some weak acting accents and overall lack of tension whilst having the overall look of a big budget for nz the feel is decidedly small town kiwi has anyone not seen the brothers those who have will pick the similarities straightaway i have heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clichéd boys talking crap but it comes across as forced i believe oscar keightley sees himself as deeply ironic but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious those who have any doubts left at all that samoans living in nz culture has been deeply  hopefully not permanently affected by american speech  culture and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie robbie magasiva always looks good on screen  but is let down by the script it always rubs me up the wrong way when a comedy has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clichéd punchline see the want to be white boy i know someone who found this movie hilarious however that person has the brains of a tadpole and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars that kind of sums up the mentality of this flick  ok but not great  fun but not funny wake up nz this is not a 5 star movie despite all the glowing middle class white guilt     reviews my advice  if you watch it get drunk first
judaai was a bold film by raj kanwar at it is time in 1997 when such a topic was damn out of the boxto give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wantsthe film however is damn melodramatic many places ridiculousone wonders why anil does not buy a tv for his wife when he earns so much just to show how poor he isthe twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of 80s the johny paresh comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it does not fit in the storyeven there are several cringeworthy scenesdirection by raj kanwar is adequate though at times too melodramatic music is okay but most songs look forcedanil does his part well sridevi is excellent in her part urmila is decent amongst rest kader khan is as usual johny lever is funny paresh irritates farida is decent
saw this movie in an early preview and i cannot stress enough how bad i thought this film was from the very beginning the audience was groaning over pacinos awful southern accent poor al looked really really haggard and i can not decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist or perhaps he just did not get any sleep before coming to the set much worse than pacinos close ups however is the wretched excuse for a plot early in the film we are given indications that pacinos character is gay and i suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended later however we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both tea leoni and kim basinger both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles lust after this elderly half dead looking effeminate man with the ridiculous accent the worst part overall was the main plot thread which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never ever care about in the slightest because this was a preview i will reserve my final judgment because of the possibility of re shoots and editing but you can bet i will not pay a cent to see this in theaters
råzone is an awful movie it is so simple it seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life just like zappa did many years ago but unfortunately denmark lacks good young actors leon are by many still the little girl in krummernes jul and laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movieeven though i consider it a movie you ought to see i do not agree that the youth are behaving like this but i think it can show how it can end if you are letting your child down also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like film folketall in all i think people should see råzone not because it is a great film but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes i also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it and actually it is in these scenes laura is acting best like the ending where she is holding the gun
mark hamill should have felt mighty embarrassed with corvette summer this time he uses a new kind of force to regain the possession of his dream machine a bright red vette it looks like another sour teen age flick the first half hour and does a you turn in heading for the wrong direction the writing and directing jobs are dreadfully done with a few scenes you can not hardly take you are expecting this to happen anyway and you are also sniffing the smell of late 70s hodgepodge only a former newcomer like annie potts would easily steal the show and save this poor movie from the repo creeps her impractical but delightful personality holds on to your interest for good and this is the finest chance to see her in a swimsuit hooray for annie sorry mark i guess the force was not with you this time around
the reviews i read for this movie were pretty decent so i decided to check it out bad idea this is another movie about a ghost out for revenge against a group friends the story is stupid mix two parts ringu with one part prom night a sprinkle of i know what you did last summer and add a tiny dash of single white female now blend until completely nonsensical there is nothing new to this plot and revisiting the clichés i have grown so fond of was not even entertaining this time this movie jumps to and from the past too much and once i made sense of it all i realized it still did not make much sense characters go from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye speaking of characters they are all your stereotypical favorites the greedy selfish lawyer the egocentric actress the has been baseball star the video voyeur the bitter girl the spooky quiet chick the nicer than nice nice girl a freakin black cat and i did not care about any of them perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work there were some decent scenes in it but overall this movie was a mess i should also mention a certain video tape that would have been impossible to shoot this movie is not the worst asian horror has to offer by far but it is still pretty bad if you just want to see some creepy images in the dark or just want to laugh out loud at some over the top acting or just want to yell you are stupid at a movie screen or just want to have another asian horror flick up your sleeve when someone asks you how many you have seen this movie is for you those seeking a decent plot look elsewhere
here we are two travelers from a distant futuristic world arrive on earth one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life another is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the saviour of an entire race so what could we call this killing machine it is almost like he is some kind of destroyer or eradicator sort of like an exterminator or something what is the word i am looking for something that terminates things hmmmm anyway the protector who swiftly doffs the white tunic he stole from luke skywalker in favour of local clothing finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a future born hero to be the evil uhhhh exterminator kills some rednecks and steals their guns and clothes then attempts to locate the woman by visiting her workplace and asking around by looking menacingly into peoples eyes and repeating her name threateningly then begins a desperate race for survival as the seemingly deathless and unstoppable exterminator pursues the couple across the countryside at some point he may acquire boots and a motorcycle but i am not sure perhaps in an exciting finale he will attempt to crush them under the wheels of an enormous tanker truck full of acid then the truck will crash they will be saved but no he will then re emerge as strong as ever he will kill the protector and pursue the girl into a meat packing plant where in a terrifying finish he is pushed into a large piece of industrial chopping machinery and destroyed once and for all but maybe i am extrapolating too much after all i did stop watching this movie after mr protector magically impregnates sean young by kissing her at a bar then tells her the child will be born in 3 days the costumes and effects are great in this movie i loved them the first time i saw them on star trek next generation too sean young does another great turn as an unemotive replicant and career sweat hog stephen baldwin is also on board as youngs fat cop boyfriend not sure where he fits into the plot though maybe he is an import from a different james cameron movie
relentlessly stupid no budget war picture made mainly to show off the attributes of the spectacular eve meyer not a bad idea in itself but that should be an embarrassment to everyone connected with it laughable script performances that would not pass muster in an elementary school christmas pageant inept action scenes confused direction by the normally competent documentary director louis clyde stoumen who is apparently not quite sure if he is making a comedy a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a leering ta by early 1960s standards anyway travelogue of eve meyers magnificent body and a general air of shoddiness and incompetence worth seeing in order to watch eve meyer strut her stuff but that is pretty much it
i bought this movie from gamestops discount used movie bin and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably so i bought it for 99cents the movie itself is retarded and they use like ten different monkeys throughout the whole film that hardly look alike not to mention they use a stunt double who is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkey the director more than likely committed a murder suicide with the chimpanzees after the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent warner bros film and he ended up owing money to the studio it also does not help that he was not even infamous for the terrible job he did he was not even known for producing a poop chute film why was this movie ever made
it is been a looooonnnggg time since i saw this comedy and i would forgotten just how idiotic it is i would place this easily in the lower two or three of elvis presleys very worst movies presley plays joe whitecloud a half breed indian bull rider who returns home to arizona and the broken down shack where his family lives and where his friends love to party all night long his parents are played by burgess meredith and katy jurado and his old indian grandpa is thomas gomez none of the three offer anything of substance  comically or otherwise the government has invested in the familys cattle but they are lacking a bull elvis gets to sing just a few utterly worthless songs and is pursued by a young boy crazy gal and her gun toting mother this is just a real slapdash of a mess and the dilapidated surroundings practically stink of manure and do not make this much easier the one thing that puzzles me however is that elvis actually seems to be having a good time in the film hard to believe considering he got so upset about being stuck making so many mediocre movies
after i watched this movie i came to imdb and read some of the reviews which compared it to lost in translation lite when i read that i immediately could see the reviewers point this movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme interestingly the format of the movie is nearly identical but the pacing is incredibly different 10 items rushes the viewer through the 1 day time line of the movie whereas the better planned lost in  seems to stretch out over a few long days i am sure some people will see this because it has morgan freeman and will be disappointed it seems his better roles now a days are supporting roles in big blockbusters rather than leading roles in sub 10mil limited release movies and indie films
the only reason i watched this film was because i had recently read robert houghs less than perfect but interesting fictionalised account of the life of big cat trainer mabel stark beaty appears as a character in the book in a less than flattering light i had not realised until checking the movie out later on the imdb that it was originally a serial whoever edited the original running time of 233 minutes down to the 68 minuted version available on dvd has done a hell of a good job the shortened version plays just as well as any b movie of the period despite the many duh what moments for instance are we really expected to believe our hero dug that twenty foot deep tiger trap in a morning without even getting his jodhpurs dirty looking over the chapter titles i see that number five is titled gorilla warfare and number eleven is called the gorilla there were no gorillas at all in the movie i guess that is where some of the cuts were made historicaly interesting
i got this movie out of blockbuster in one of those racks were you can get like 5 movies for 20 bucks i would have to say i got my moneys worth on this one i had expected horrible dialogue crappy monsters and shaky cameras well as meatloaf said two outta three are not bad the acting is bad though not as bad as some movies i have seen or maybe i have watched so many low budget movies recently i have lost perspective there are some bits were the acting is downright terrible but for the most part it is of at least high school play level the cg for the sasquatch in this movie is probably the second worst part the first thing i thought when i saw it and i noticed another reviewer agreed with me was that a man in an ape suit would have been better clunky stop motion animation would have looked better so you may be asking why i call the cg the second worst part that is because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects they are loud annoying and constant i have been camping i know what insects sound like in the woods at night and while they can be loud they are not deafening like the cacophony in this movie usually when the background sounds drown out the movies dialogue it is a bad thing but from what i caught of the dialogue of this film i was not missing much the action was infrequent and boring the tension was non existent as was any sense of empathy with the characters speaking of the characters they were all cookie cutter and bland the only mildly engaging byplay was between actually i can not think of anything there was a line or two that made me crack a wan smile but that was about it the cinematography was decent a step or two above what you would normally see in a movie like this however it still had that home movie quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket change and a prayer if you are like me and get a kick out of shoestring budget genre flicks and you see this one in the dollar bin think about grabbing it otherwise stay away at all costs
has to be one of the worst wastes of 35mm movie film ever unleashed on the public the sequel to the at least entertaining pseudo documentary original film the legend of boggy creek bad script worse acting etc  etc  dawn wells had to be hoping that gilligan would come rescue her and take her back to the island just to escape from this piece of clap trap
when i rented this movie i had very low expectations but when i saw it i realized that the movie was less a lot less than what i expected the actors were bad the doctors wife was one of the worst the story was so stupid it could work for a disney movie except for the murders but this one is not a comedy it is a laughable masterpiece of stupidity the title is well chosen except for one thing they could add stupid movie after dead husbands i give it 0 and a half out of 5
even if one did not realize that sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and passed away before the films release the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu would be painful viewing it is supposedly a lampoon of sax rohmers famous oriental villain but it lacks any focus the potential for satirical commentary on the anti oriental overtones of rohmers concept are ignored indeed the movie employs racist insults there are hardly any actual jokes or gags just mostly actors behaving idiotically and spouting dreary lines it is especially distressing to see sid caesar forced to spout curses and racial slurs for attempted laughs most of the other actors embarrass themselves as well and then there is peter sellers he plays the dual roles of the sinister fu manchu who is trying to concoct a formula to regain his youth and his stalwart british foe nayland smith sellers is not one hundred per cent bad he conveys a quirky warmth as smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and he is oddly moving as manchu when he expresses his love for english music hall entertainment but most of the time he plays both roles with a weary grimness thus further sabotaging any comical possibilities sellers routines where he revitalizes his fading strength with electric shocks are particularly excruciating he seems too convincingly agonized to be funny a few genuinely witty lines an apt slapstick bit by burt kwouk cato in the pink panther films as one of manchus minions and helen mirrens amusing musical numbers cannot salvage this mess if anyone wants to understand why peter sellers is considered a comedic genius they will not learn anything from the fiendish plot of dr fu manchu
this movie had what sounded like a good premise 9 people facing their fears to win one million dollars unfortunately it did not turn out to be a good movie there are several scenes that are way too long and really pointless like the dancing scene a few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts the acting is bad but some of the lines are amusing in their awfulness what is really strange is that towards the end of the movie it turns into like a 5 minute western and at the end the twists of which their were several do not make sense with the rest of the movie it seemed as though the director just added stuff on because he thought it would look cool while conveniently ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point it just did not make a lot of sense the only creepy thing was the old people dancing down the hall but that does not even come close to making up for the rest of this mess
if you read my review of syfys dinoshark you know that i can appreciate the low budget schlock that these made for television movies can provide they are stupid they are silly but they are still pretty fun in a so bad it is good kind of way so still smacking with guilt for liking and recommending the undeniably hokey dinoshark i sat down to watch hammerhead shark frenzy a syfy original movie about a half man half hammerhead monster terrorizing people on an island with the syfy channels sure fire recipe for creating b movie creature features and a cast that includes william forsythe and hunter tylo how could it possibly go wrong well to my surprise it actually misses the mark not by much but enough to make me not recommend it why well first of all its titular monster the dreaded hammerhead human hybrid takes a backseat to a bunch of faux military thugs who really become the movies primary villain though the hammerhead does rack up the body count he or it or whatever you call the thing only arrives just before someone is going to be munched upon and leaves directly after the rest of the movie is filler pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers that to me is just not as compelling as watching a walking hammerhead eat people please read the full review on my blog www horrormoviejournal blogspot com
from the what was she thinking file whoopi goldberg plays a cop in the future who is teamed with a talking dinosaur  for a crime case involving a madman who wants to start another ice age straight to tape oddity is embarrassing and ridiculous a high concept in search of itself apparently this was a labor of love for its writer director jonathan betuel who also served as one of the producers sadly the end results are anemic to be charitable goldbergs mere presence on screen can often spark good will and laughter no matter how poor the script but here she is drowning and you can see the unfunny results no stars from 
i got this as a turkey movie and was i not disappointed acting overall even though many have been in other movies it is clear that they had to work hard to act this bad so constantly over this entire movie with out accidentally letting slip some degree of acting plot being generous i could say that the scriptwriter did originally start with a plot but but did his best to ignore it the plot broke down faster then a chinese knock off computer scrip now that was an abomination of nature it failed to flow with any rhyme or reason the majority of the lines by the characters were at best pathetic to imbecilic the script worked hard to make sure that no character managed to get to be considered memorable i have watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable special effects rotflmao they were short bus special directing until you can come up with your own directing ability copy the style of your favorite directer otherwise you will only make failures like this it is good to know that your friendsfamily have been giving you 10 stars for this movie
in the first one it was mainly giant rats but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too this one however is just giant rats period well giant rats and one really growing little boy this one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats you know how it is this movie has some kills and its moments but i find it to be on par with the original i just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies well that is not true i actually like empire of the ants maybe i just do not care for giant rodents all in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre i just can not recommend this one
